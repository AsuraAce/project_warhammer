This document serves as the definitive authority on the action system and explicitly corrects the misconception of \"Half Actions.\"\n\n---\n\n**I. The Core Rule of a Turn**\n\n> On your turn, you may perform **one Move** and **one Action**, in any order you choose.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Components of a Turn**\n\n> **A. The Action**\n> *   Your primary task for the turn. Most tasks that require a Test use your Action.\n> *   **Examples:** Attacking (`Melee`/`Ranged` Test), Casting a Spell (`Cast` Test), Using a Skill (`Climb`, `Intimidate`, etc.), Aiming, Guarding, or using the `On The Defensive` option.\n>\n> **B. The Move**\n> *   Used to change your position on the battlefield. You can move a  x2 Movement Characteristic number of yards.\n> *   A Move can be used to stand up from being Prone, or to move into or out of engagement (with consequences).\n>\n> **C. Free Actions**\n> *   Minor activities that do not require a Test and do not use up your Move or Action.\n> *   A character can perform a reasonable number of Free Actions per turn, at the GM's discretion.\n> *   **Examples:** Shouting a warning, dropping an item, changing your grip on a weapon.\n>\n> **D. Reactions**\n> *   A special activity performed **outside of your turn**, typically in response to being targeted by an attack.\n> *   **Example:** Using the `Dodge` skill to avoid a hit.\n\n---\n\n**III. Using Your Action for Movement**\n\n> While you normally have one **Move** and one **Action**, you can use your Action to perform specific movement tasks. The primary ways to do this are:\n>\n> *   You can use your **Action** to perform a second **Walk** (another Move Action).\n> *   You can use your **Action** to perform a **Charge**, which combines movement and a Melee Attack.\n> *   You can use your **Action** to **Sprint (Run)**, which requires an Athletics Test for a burst of speed.\n>\n> *Note: For the specific distances and rules for these actions, refer to the `Cheat Sheet: Combat & Movement`.*\n\n---\n",

Combat Structure & Flow**\n\n> **A. Timing & Turn Structure**\n> *   **Rounds:** A Round is a short period of time (a few seconds) in which every combatant gets to act.\n> *   **Turns:** During a Round, each combatant has one Turn.\n>\n> **B. Initiative Order**\n> *   **Standard Rule:** Combatants act in order of their **Initiative Characteristic**, from highest to lowest.\n> *   **Tie-Breaker:** If Initiatives are tied, the combatant with the higher **Agility** acts first. If still tied, an **Opposed Agility Test** determines the order.\n>\n> **C. The Combat Loop**\n> 1.  **Determine Surprise:** The GM determines if one side has surprised the other.\n> 2.  **Round Begins:** A new round starts. Any \"start of the round\" effects trigger.\n> 3.  **Characters Take Turns:** Each combatant takes their turn according to the initiative order.\n> 4.  **Round Ends:** Once all have acted, the round ends. Any \"end of the round\" effects trigger.\n> 5.  **Repeat:** The loop continues until the combat is resolved.\n\n---\n\n**II. Starting Combat: Surprise**\n\n> **A. Achieving Surprise**\n> *   An attack may be a surprise if the attackers use Hiding, Sneaky Tactics (darkness, fog), or Distractions.\n>\n> **B. Resolution**\n> *   This is resolved with an **Opposed Stealth vs. Perception Test**. The ambusher with the **lowest Stealth skill** makes the roll against all potential spotters.\n>\n> **C. Outcome**\n> *   **Success (Ambushers Win):** Characters who fail their Perception test gain the **Surprised Condition**. A Surprised character may spend one **Resolve Point** to remove the condition.\n> *   **Failure (Defenders Win):** The ambush is spotted. Combat proceeds as normal.\n\n---\n\n> **III. Your Turn: The Action Economy**\n>\n> On your turn, you have a set of resources to spend: **one Action**, **one Move**, and a reasonable number of **Free Actions**. You may use your Action and Move in any order. For a complete breakdown of the action economy, refer to **`Cheat Sheet: Action Economy (WFRP 4e)`**.\n>\n> *   **Action:** Your primary task for the turn, such as attacking, casting a spell, or using a skill.\n> *   **Move:** Used to change your position on the battlefield.\n> *   **Free Actions:** Minor activities that don't require a Test, such as shouting a warning or drawing a weapon.\n> *   **Optional Rule (On The Defensive):** As your Action, you can choose a Skill to use defensively (e.g., Dodge, Melee). You gain a **+20 bonus** to all defensive Tests made with that Skill until the start of your next Turn.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Movement in Combat**\n\n> **A. The Move Action (Walk)**\n> *   On your turn, you have one **Move Action**.\n> *   Using your Move Action allows you to **Walk**, covering a distance in yards equal to your `Movement Characteristic x 2`.\n>\n> **B. Using Your Main Action for Movement**\n> > You can use your main **Action** for the turn to move in one of the following ways. These are distinct from your Move Action.\n>\n> *   **Perform a Second Walk:** You can use your **Action** to perform a second **Walk**. This is a reliable, test-free way to cover more ground.\n>     *   **Total Distance:** `(Movement x 2) + (Movement x 2) = Movement x 4` yards.\n> *   **Charge:** Use your **Action** to move up to `Movement x 3` yards and make one **Melee Attack**.\n>     *   **Constraint:** You can only declare a Charge if an opponent is within your maximum charge distance.\n>     *   **Advantage:** If the charge distance is greater than your Walk distance (`Movement x 2`), you gain **+1 Advantage** before your attack.\n> *   **Sprint (Run):** Use your **Action** to make an **Average (+20) Athletics Test**. This is a high-risk, high-reward action for covering maximum ground, performed in addition to your standard Walk.\n>     *   **Total Distance:** `(Movement x 2)` from your Walk **+** `(Movement x 4) + SL` from your Sprint Test.\n>\n> **C. Engagement & Fleeing**\n> *   **Engaged:** You are Engaged if you are in melee combat with an opponent.\n> *   **Disengaging:** To leave engagement without penalty, you must either use Advantage or win an Opposed Dodge/Melee Test as your Action.\n> *   **Fleeing:** If you turn your back on an Engaged opponent to flee, they gain **+1 Advantage** and a **free, Unopposed Melee Test** against you with a **+20 bonus**.\n>\n> **D. Other Movement**\n> *   **Climbing:** Easy surfaces cost double the movement rate. Difficult surfaces require a **Climb Test** as your Action.\n",

The combatant with the highest SL wins.\n>     *   **If you win:** You hit and gain **+1 Advantage**.\n>     *   **If you lose:** Your opponent gains **+1 Advantage**, and your Action is finished.\n> *   **Ranged Attack:**\n>     *   Perform a **Ranged Test**.\n>     *   **If you succeed:** You hit and gain **+1 Advantage**.\n>     *   **If you fail:** Your Action is finished.\n\n**Step 2: Determine Hit Location**\n> *   If your attack hits, **reverse the digits of your successful d100 roll** and consult the **`hit_location_table.json`** file to find the location struck.\n\n**Step 3: Determine Damage**\n> *   **Formula:** `Damage = Weapon Damage + SL`\n\n**Step 4: Apply Damage**\n> *   **Formula:** `Wounds Suffered = Damage - (Opponent’s Toughness Bonus + Armour Points on Hit Location)`\n> *   The minimum Wounds Suffered from any attack is **1**.\n> *   If the Wounds Suffered exceeds the opponent's remaining Wounds, the opponent suffers a **Critical Wound** and gains the **Prone Condition**.\n\n---\n\n**II. Special Attack Results**\n\n**A. Criticals**\n> *   **Trigger:** A successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double (e.g., 11, 22, 33).\n> *   **Effect:** Your opponent immediately suffers a **Critical Wound**.\n> *   **Pulling Blows:** You may declare you are \"pulling your blow\" *before* you roll to hit. If you do, you may choose to ignore any Critical Hit you would otherwise inflict.\n\n**B. Fumbles**\n> *   **Trigger:** A failed Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double (e.g., 77, 88, 99).\n> *   **Effect:** Roll 1d100 and consult the **`fumble_table.json`** file to determine the consequence.\n\n**C. Misfires!**\n> *   **Trigger:** A Fumble with a **Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive** weapon on an **Even Number** (e.g., 88, 00).\n> *   **Outcome:** The weapon is destroyed. The wielder is hit on their Primary Arm for the weapon's full damage, using the units die of the Fumble roll as the SL.\n\n---\n\n**III. Common Combat Modifiers**\n\n**A. Helpless Targets**\n> *   Melee Tests to hit a helpless target **automatically succeed**.\n\n**B. Outnumbering (Melee)**\n> *   **2-to-1:** Gain a **+20 bonus** to hit.\n> *   **3-to-1:** Gain a **+40 bonus** to hit.\n\n**C. Ranged Attack Modifiers**\n> *   **Shooting into a Group:**\n>     *   Small Group (3-6): +20 bonus.\n>     *   Large Group (7-12): +40 bonus.\n>     *   Massive Group (13+): +60 bonus.\n> *   **Size Modifiers:**\n>     *   Refer to the `size_table.json` for specific modifiers.\n> *   **Optional Rule (Shooting into Melee):** Ranged attacks against an Engaged target suffer a **–20 penalty**. If this causes a failure, you hit one of the target’s allies instead.\n",

Two-Weapon Fighting**\n\n> When fighting with a weapon in each hand (one-handed melee weapons or pistols), the following rules apply:\n> *   You may use either hand to make an attack.\n> *   Attacks made using your **secondary hand** suffer a **Hard (–20) penalty**.\n> *   The **Dual Wielder** Talent may allow you to attack with both weapons in a single turn.\n\n---\n\n**II. Unarmed Combat & Grappling**\n\n> **A. Initiating a Grapple**\n> *   Instead of inflicting damage with an unarmed attack, you can declare your intent to **Grapple** before making your Opposed Melee (Brawling) Test.\n> *   If you win, you and your opponent are now Grappling, and your opponent gains the **Entangled** Condition.\n>\n> **B. Actions While Grappling**\n> *   If you begin your turn Grappling, you must make an **Opposed Strength Test** as your Action.\n> *   **If you win,** choose one:\n>     *   **Inflict Damage:** Deal `SB + SL` damage, ignoring Armour Points.\n>     *   **Control Grapple:** Give your opponent one **Entangled** Condition, OR remove one from yourself (plus one extra for each SL you won by).\n> *   **If you lose,** your opponent gains **+1 Advantage**.\n>\n> **C. Attacking Grapplers**\n> *   Characters outside the grapple gain a **+20 bonus** to hit the grappler with lower Advantage and a **+10 bonus** to hit the one with higher Advantage.\n\n---\n\n**III. Mounted Combat**\n\n> *   **Movement:** You use your mount's Movement characteristic and your **Ride Skill** for movement tests.\n> *   **Melee Bonus:** You gain a **+20 bonus** to melee attacks against any target smaller than your mount.\n> *   **Targeting:** An attacker can target either the rider or the mount. If an attacker is smaller than the mount, they suffer a **–10 penalty** to melee attacks targeting the rider.\n> *   **Mount's Action:** A mount without the `Skittish` Trait may use its own Action to attack.\n> *   **Charging:** When Charging, you may use your mount's Strength and Size for calculating damage.\n> *   **Dodging:** You suffer a **–20 penalty** to Dodge Tests while mounted, unless you have the **Trick Riding** Talent.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Scatter**\n\n> This mechanic determines where a missed thrown weapon or misfired projectile lands.\n> *   **Trigger:** A failed Ranged (Throwing) Test, or a misfire from a weapon with the **Unreliable** Flaw.\n> *   **Resolution:**\n>     1.  Roll **1d10** and consult the **`scatter_table.json`** file to determine the direction and distance of the scatter.\n>     2.  The distance rolled cannot exceed half the original distance to the target.\n\n---\n\n**V. Pursuit**\n\n> 1.  **Determine Distance:** The GM assigns a \"Distance\" number representing the quarry's head start (typically 1-8).\n> 2.  **Test:** Everyone in the pursuit makes a relevant movement Test (e.g., Athletics, Ride). Characters with a higher Movement characteristic gain a bonus SL equal to the difference.\n> 3.  **Update Distance:** Compare the **lowest SL** of the pursued group against the **highest SL** of the pursuers. The difference is added to the Distance (if pursued won) or subtracted (if pursuers won).\n> 4.  **Determine Outcome:** If Distance is **0 or less**, the pursuers have caught their quarry. If Distance is **10 or more**, the quarry has escaped.\n\n---\n\n**VI. Optional Rule: Deathblow**\n\n> *   **Trigger:** If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow.\n> *   **Effect:** You may immediately move into the defeated opponent's space and make another attack against a different, available opponent.\n> *   **Limitation:** You may do this a number of times per Turn equal to your **Weapon Skill Bonus**.\n",

General Rules for Conditions**\n\n> **A. Losing Advantage**\n> *   Suffering **any** Condition immediately causes you to lose **all** of your Advantage.\n>\n> **B. Multiple Conditions**\n> *   **Stacking the Same Condition:** If you receive the same Condition multiple times, its numerical penalties stack (e.g., 3 Bleeding Conditions means you lose 3 Wounds per round).\n> *   **Multiple Different Conditions:** If you have several different Conditions, you only suffer the single **highest** penalty from among them (e.g., if you are Fatigued [-10] and Prone [-20], you suffer a -20 penalty, not -30).\n>\n> **C. Removing Conditions with Resolve**\n> *   You may spend one **Resolve Point** to immediately remove one Condition of your choice.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Condition List**\n\n> **Ablaze**\n> *   **Effect:** At the end of each Round, you suffer `1d10 + (number of Ablaze Conditions - 1)` Damage. This is reduced by your Toughness Bonus and the Armour Points on your least protected location (min 1 Wound).\n> *   **Removal:** Make an **Athletics Test**. You remove 1 Ablaze Condition, plus 1 for each SL scored.\n>\n> **Bleeding**\n> *   **Effect:** At the end of each Round, you lose 1 Wound per Bleeding Condition (ignoring all modifiers). You suffer a –10 penalty to Tests to resist infections.\n> *   **At 0 Wounds:** You gain the **Unconscious** Condition. At the end of each Round, you have a 10% chance of dying per Bleeding Condition you possess.\n> *   **Removal:** A successful **Heal Test** removes 1 Bleeding Condition, plus 1 per SL. Spells or Prayers that heal Wounds also remove 1 Bleeding Condition per Wound healed.\n> *   **Aftermath:** Once all are removed, gain 1 **Fatigued** Condition.\n>\n> **Blinded**\n> *   **Effect:** Suffer a –10 penalty to all sight-based Tests. Opponents in melee gain a +10 bonus to hit you.\n> *   **Removal:** One Blinded Condition is removed automatically at the end of every other Round.\n>\n> **Broken**\n> *   **Effect:** You are panicked. You must use your Move and Action to flee to a safe hiding place. You suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests not related to running or hiding.\n> *   **Removal:** You cannot rally while Engaged. If unengaged, you may make a **Cool Test** at the end of the Round to remove 1 Broken Condition, plus 1 per SL.\n> *   **Aftermath:** Once all are removed, gain 1 **Fatigued** Condition.\n>\n> **Deafened**\n> *   **Effect:** Suffer a –10 penalty to all hearing-based Tests. Opponents attacking from the flank or rear gain a +10 bonus to hit you.\n> *   **Removal:** One Deafened Condition is removed automatically at the end of every other Round.\n>\n> **Entangled**\n> *   **Effect:** You cannot Move. You suffer a –10 penalty to all movement-based Actions (including Grappling).\n> *   **Removal:** As your Action, win an **Opposed Strength Test** against the source. You remove 1 Entangled Condition, plus 1 per SL.\n>\n> **Fatigued**\n> *   **Effect:** You are exhausted. You suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests.\n> *   **Removal:** Requires rest, a spell, or a divine effect.\n>\n> **Poisoned**\n> *   **Effect:** At the end of each Round, you lose 1 Wound (ignoring all modifiers). You suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests.\n> *   **At 0 Wounds:** You cannot heal. If you fall Unconscious, you must pass an **Endurance Test** after a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus, or you die.\n> *   **Removal:** At the end of each Round, you may make an **Endurance Test** or a **Heal Test**. A success removes 1 Poisoned Condition, plus 1 per SL.\n> *   **Aftermath:** Once all are removed, gain 1 **Fatigued** Condition.\n>\n> **Prone**\n> *   **Effect:** You are on the ground. Your Move can only be used to stand up or crawl at half your Movement. You suffer a –20 penalty to all movement-based Tests. Opponents in melee gain a +20 bonus to hit you.\n> *   **Removal:** You lose the Prone Condition when you use your Move to stand up.\n>\n> **Stunned**\n> *   **Effect:** You are disoriented. You cannot take an Action, but can Move at half speed. You can defend in Opposed Tests (except with magic). You suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests. Opponents in melee gain +1 Advantage before attacking you.\n> *   **Removal:** At the end of each Round, make a **Challenging (+0) Endurance Test**. A success removes 1 Stunned Condition, plus 1 per SL.\n> *   **Aftermath:** Once all are removed, gain 1 **Fatigued** Condition.\n>\n> **Surprised**\n> *   **Effect:** You are caught unawares. You can take no Action or Move. You cannot defend in Opposed Tests. Opponents in melee gain a +20 bonus to hit you.\n> *   **Removal:** You lose the Surprised Condition at the end of the Round, or after the first attempt to attack you, whichever comes first.\n>\n> **Unconscious**\n> *   **Effect:** You are knocked out. You can do nothing and are unaware of your surroundings. Melee attacks targeting you are devastatingly effective.\n> *   **Removal:** Typically requires being healed for at least 1 Wound.\n> *   **Aftermath:** When you lose the Unconscious Condition, you gain the **Prone** and **Fatigued** Conditions.\n\n---",

            "content": "### **`Cheat Sheet: Injury & Healing`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To define the rules for suffering and recovering from Wounds, Critical Wounds, and other lasting injuries.\n\n---\n\n**I. Wounds & Damage**\n\n> **A. Suffering Wounds**\n> *   Wound loss represents minor cuts, bruises, and general fatigue from combat.\n> *   **Formula:** `Wounds Suffered = Damage - (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)`\n>\n> **B. Reaching Zero Wounds**\n> *   If your Wounds are reduced to 0, you immediately gain the **Prone** Condition. You cannot remove this Condition until you have at least 1 Wound.\n> *   If you are not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your **Toughness Bonus**, you also gain the **Unconscious** Condition.\n>\n> **C. Damage Overflow**\n> *   If an attack deals more damage than you have Wounds remaining, the excess amount is called **Damage Overflow**.\n> *   The primary and immediate consequence of suffering any amount of Damage Overflow is that you suffer a **Critical Wound**.\n>\n> **D. Important: No Negative Wound Tracking**\n> *   The game system **does not** track a negative Wound total. When damage takes a character below 0 Wounds, their Wound total is simply treated as **0** for all subsequent mechanical purposes until they are healed.\n> *   The amount of Damage Overflow serves only as a **one-time trigger** to cause a Critical Wound and potentially modify the roll on the Critical Table. It is not a persistent value and should not be recorded.\n\n---\n\n**II. Critical Wounds**\n\n> **A. Inflicting Critical Wounds**\n> *   Critical Wounds represent severe, specific injuries. They are caused by:\n>     1.  Scoring a **Critical Hit** on an attack roll.\n>     2.  Suffering **Damage Overflow**.\n> *   The effects are determined by rolling on the appropriate **Critical Table** for the hit location.\n>\n> **B. Optional Rule: Damage Overflow Modifier**\n> *   If a Critical Wound was caused by Damage Overflow, you may apply a modifier to the roll on the Critical Table.\n> *   If the amount of Damage Overflow was **less than** your Toughness Bonus, you may subtract **-20** from the result on the Critical Table (to a minimum result of 01).\n>\n> **C. Optional Rule: Pulling Blows**\n> *   You may declare you are \"pulling your blow\" *before* you roll to hit. If you do, you may choose to ignore any Critical Hit you would otherwise inflict.\n\n---\n\n**III. Death**\n\n> **A. Conditions for Death**\n> > You are at risk of death if you meet **all three** of the following criteria simultaneously:\n> > 1.  You have 0 Wounds remaining.\n> > 2.  You have the **Unconscious** Condition.\n> > 3.  Your total number of Critical Wounds is **greater than** your Toughness Bonus.\n> *   If all these conditions are met, **you die at the end of the Round** unless a Critical Wound is healed.\n>\n> **B. Optional Rule: Sudden Death**\n> *   For minor NPCs, the GM may rule that if they suffer Damage Overflow, they simply die or fall unconscious immediately, without tracking Critical Wounds.\n\n---\n\n**IV. The Healing Process**\n\n> **A. Healing Wounds**\n> *   **Natural Healing (Good Sleep):** Once per day, you may make an **Average (+20) Endurance Test**. You heal a number of Wounds equal to `SL + Toughness Bonus`.\n> *   **Natural Healing (Taking it Easy):** For each day spent resting, you heal a number of Wounds equal to your **Toughness Bonus**.\n> *   **Medical Attention:** Wounds can also be healed via the **Heal** skill, bandages, poultices, or magic.\n>\n> **B. Healing Critical Wounds**\n> *   A Critical Wound is not considered healed until all Conditions it inflicts are removed and all non-permanent modifiers are resolved.\n> *   **Medical Attention:** Some Criticals require \"Medical Attention\" to be resolved. This can be a successful **Heal Test**, the application of a bandage/poulitce, or a healing spell/prayer.\n> *   **Surgery:** The most severe Criticals require the **Surgery** Talent to be properly healed. An amputated body part also requires Surgery; until it is received, 1 Wound from the injury cannot be healed.\n\n---\n\n**V. Lasting Injuries**\n\n> **A. Broken Bones**\n> *   **Minor:** The hit location is unusable. Heals in `30 + 1d10` days. Afterwards, pass an **Average (+20) Endurance Test** or suffer a permanent -5 penalty to relevant tests. A successful **Heal Test** within a week negates the need for this final Endurance Test.\n> *   **Major:** Same as Minor, but healing takes 10 days longer, all associated tests are one step more difficult, and the permanent penalty for failure increases to -10.\n>\n> **B. Torn Muscles**\n> *   **Minor:** Suffer a -10 penalty to all tests involving the location. If a leg is hit, your Movement is halved. Heals in `30 - Toughness Bonus` days.\n> *   **Major:** Same as Minor, but the penalty is -20. After `30 - Toughness Bonus` days, the penalty reduces to -10. It heals completely after another `30 - Toughness Bonus` days.\n>\n> **C. Amputated Parts**\n> *   When you suffer an Amputation, you must pass an **Endurance Test** (difficulty specified by the Critical Wound) or gain the **Prone** Condition.\n> *   **Arm:** Cannot use two-handed weapons. A shield can be strapped to the stump.\n> *   **Ear:** -5 Fellowship penalty per lost ear. If both are lost, -20 to hearing-based Perception tests.\n> *   **Eye:** -5 Fellowship penalty per scarred socket. If both are lost, -30 to sight-based tests.\n> *   **Fingers:** For each lost finger, the Fumble range on relevant failed tests increases by 1. Suffer a -5 penalty to tests using that hand per finger lost.\n> *   **Foot:** Movement is permanently halved. -20 penalty to all mobility-based tests.\n> *   **Hand:** -20 penalty to all tests requiring two hands. Cannot use two-handed weapons.\n> *   **Leg:** Same as a lost foot, but you cannot use the Dodge skill at all.\n> *   **Nose:** Permanent -20 to Fellowship and -30 penalty to smell-based tests.\n> *   **Teeth:** Permanent -1 Fellowship for every two teeth lost.\n> *   **Tongue:** Automatically fail all spoken Language Tests.\n\n***\n",

Wounds & Damage**\n\n> **A. Suffering Wounds**\n> *   Wound loss represents minor cuts, bruises, and general fatigue from combat.\n> *   **Formula:** `Wounds Suffered = Damage - (Toughness Bonus + Armour Points)`\n>\n> **B. Reaching Zero Wounds**\n> *   If your Wounds are reduced to 0, you immediately gain the **Prone** Condition. You cannot remove this Condition until you have at least 1 Wound.\n> *   If you are not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your **Toughness Bonus**, you also gain the **Unconscious** Condition.\n>\n> **C. Going Below Zero Wounds**\n> *   If you take enough damage to go into negative Wounds, you suffer a **Critical Wound**.\n> *   If the amount of negative damage is less than your Toughness Bonus, you may subtract -20 from the result on the Critical Table (minimum result of 01).\n\n---\n\n**II. Critical Wounds**\n\n> **A. Inflicting Critical Wounds**\n> *   Critical Wounds represent severe, specific injuries. They are caused by:\n>     1.  Scoring a **Critical Hit** on an attack.\n>     2.  Taking more damage than you have Wounds remaining.\n> *   The effects are determined by rolling on the appropriate **Critical Table** for the hit location.\n>\n> **B. Optional Rule: Pulling Blows**\n> *   You may declare you are \"pulling your blow\" *before* you roll to hit. If you do, you may choose to ignore any Critical Hit you would otherwise inflict.\n\n---\n\n**III. Death**\n\n> **A. Conditions for Death**\n> > You are at risk of death if you meet **all three** of the following criteria simultaneously:\n> > 1.  You have 0 Wounds remaining.\n> > 2.  You have the **Unconscious** Condition.\n> > 3.  Your total number of Critical Wounds is **greater than** your Toughness Bonus.\n> *   If all these conditions are met, **you die at the end of the Round** unless a Critical Wound is healed.\n\n---\n\n**IV. The Healing Process**\n\n> **A. Healing Wounds**\n> *   **Natural Healing (Good Sleep):** Once per day, you may make an **Average (+20) Endurance Test**. You heal a number of Wounds equal to `SL + Toughness Bonus`.\n> *   **Natural Healing (Taking it Easy):** For each day spent resting, you heal a number of Wounds equal to your **Toughness Bonus**.\n> *   **Medical Attention:** Wounds can also be healed via the **Heal** skill, bandages, poultices, or magic.\n>\n> **B. Healing Critical Wounds**\n> *   A Critical Wound is not considered healed until all Conditions it inflicts are removed and all non-permanent modifiers are resolved.\n> *   **Medical Attention:** Some Criticals require \"Medical Attention\" to be resolved. This can be a successful **Heal Test**, the application of a bandage/poulitce, or a healing spell/prayer.\n> *   **Surgery:** The most severe Criticals require the **Surgery** Talent to be properly healed.\n\n---\n\n**V. Lasting Injuries**\n\n> Certain Critical Wounds can result in long-term or permanent injuries such as broken bones, torn muscles, or amputations. The specific mechanical effects, healing times, and penalties for these injuries are detailed in the **`lasting_injuries.json`** data file.\n",

The difficulty is set by the GM.\n> *   A success typically lasts for the encounter, but the GM may call for new tests if circumstances change dramatically.\n\n---\n\n**II. Core Psychological Traits**\n\n> **Animosity (Target)**\n> *   **Trigger:** Encountering the target group.\n> *   **Test:** Pass a Psychology Test.\n> *   **Success:** You suffer a -20 penalty to Fellowship Tests towards the target group.\n> *   **Failure:** You are subject to Animosity. You must immediately attack the target, either socially (insults) or physically. You gain +1 SL on social/mental attacks against them. You may test again each Round to end the effect.\n>\n> **Fear (Rating)**\n> *   **Trigger:** Encountering a source of Fear.\n> *   **Test:** You must pass an **Extended Cool Test** with a target SL equal to the creature's Fear Rating. You may test once per Round.\n> *   **Effect (while subject to Fear):**\n>     *   Suffer -1 SL on all Tests that affect the source of your Fear.\n>     *   You cannot move closer to the source without passing a Challenging (+0) Cool Test.\n>     *   If the source moves closer to you, you must pass a Challenging (+0) Cool Test or gain 1 **Broken** Condition.\n>\n> **Frenzy**\n> *   **Trigger:** You may choose to make a **Willpower Test** to enter a Frenzy.\n> *   **Effect (while in Frenzy):**\n>     *   You are immune to all other Psychology.\n>     *   You will not flee or retreat.\n>     *   You must move towards and attack the closest enemy.\n>     *   You gain **+1 Free Action Melee Test** each Round.\n>     *   You gain **+1 Strength Bonus**.\n> *   **Ending Frenzy:** The Frenzy ends when all enemies are pacified or you are Stunned/Unconscious. You then gain 1 **Fatigued** Condition.\n>\n> **Hatred (Target)**\n> *   **Trigger:** Encountering the target group.\n> *   **Test:** Pass a Psychology Test.\n> *   **Failure:** You are subject to Hatred. You must attempt to destroy the target by the most direct means. You gain +1 SL on all combat Tests against them and are immune to Fear/Intimidation from them (but not Terror). You may test again each Round to end the effect.\n>\n> **Prejudice (Target)**\n> *   **Trigger:** Encountering the target group.\n> *   **Test:** Pass a Psychology Test.\n> *   **Success:** You suffer a -10 penalty to Fellowship Tests towards the target group.\n> *   **Failure:** You are subject to Prejudice. You must immediately and loudly insult the target. You may test again each Round to end the effect.\n>\n> **Terror (Rating)**\n> *   **Trigger:** The *first time* you encounter a source of Terror.\n> *   **Test:** Make a **Cool Test**.\n> *   **Failure:** You gain a number of **Broken Conditions** equal to `Terror Rating + SLs of failure`.\n> *   **Aftermath:** After this one-time test, the creature no longer causes Terror to you, but instead causes **Fear (Rating)** equal to its Terror Rating.\n\n---\n\n**III. Custom Psychological Traits (Optional Rule)**\n\n> You can create custom psychological traits to reflect a character's unique history and personality.\n>\n> **Sample Custom Traits:**\n> *   **Camaraderie (Target):** You must come to the aid of the target group if they are threatened. You gain **+1 SL** to any Tests made to defend or support them.\n> *   **Love (Target):** You must come to the aid of your loved one if they are threatened. You are immune to **Fear** and **Intimidation** while defending them, and you gain **+1 SL** to all related Tests.\n> *   **Phobia (Target):** The specified object or creature causes **Fear (1)**.\n> *   **Trauma (Trigger):** A specific event (e.g., seeing someone on fire) forces a **Cool Test**. Failure results in gaining one or more Conditions (e.g., Stunned, Broken).\n\n---\n",

            "content": "### **`Cheat Sheet: Status & Social Standing`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To define the Status system, which governs social hierarchy, interactions, and income in the Old World.\n\n---\n\n**I. Core Concept: A Stratified Society**\n\n> The society of the Old World is rigidly structured. A character's **Status** represents their place in this hierarchy and modifies social interactions between people of different classes. Status is composed of two parts: a **Tier** and a **Standing**.\n\n---\n\n**II. Tiers and Standing**\n\n> *   **Tier:** The primary measure of Status, divided into Gold, Silver, and Brass. A higher Tier always means higher Status.\n> *   **Standing:** A number (typically 1-5) that represents your influence and respect *within* your Tier. If two characters are in the same Tier, the one with the higher Standing has the higher Status.\n\n---\n\n**III. The Three Tiers**\n\n> **A. The Gold Tier**\n> > Reserved for the rulers of society, their direct advisors, high-ranking officers, and the independently wealthy. Characters in the Gold Tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than all those in the Silver and Brass tiers.\n>\n> **B. The Silver Tier**\n> > Populated by skilled professionals, well-to-do townsfolk, merchants, and expert artisans. They lead respectable, if relatively humble, lives and are of higher Status than anyone in the Brass Tier.\n>\n> **C. The Brass Tier**\n> > The lowest rung of society, occupied by peasants, unskilled laborers, criminals, and beggars. This is the largest segment of the Empire's population.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Determining and Changing Status**\n\n> **A. Determining Status**\n> > Your Status is determined by your current Career Level. Each level has a specific Tier and Standing associated with it (e.g., \"Silver 2\").\n>\n> **B. Changing Status**\n> > Your Status changes for one of three reasons:\n> > 1.  You change your Career to one with a different Status.\n> > 2.  You gain a Talent that explicitly modifies your Status.\n> > 3.  The GM imposes a change due to significant in-game events.\n\n---\n\n**V. The Effects of Status on Skills**\n\nStatus directly influences the outcome of certain social Skill Tests.\n\n> **A. Charm**\n> *   **Standard:** Gain a **+10 bonus** when using Charm on a character of a lower Tier. Suffer a **-10 penalty** when using Charm on a character of a higher Tier.\n> *   **Optional Rule (Begging):** A character in the Brass Tier gains a **+10 bonus** (instead of a penalty) when using Charm to beg from a character in the Silver Tier.\n>\n> **B. Entertain**\n> *   Status does not grant a direct modifier. However, the GM may apply situational modifiers based on the appropriateness of the performance for the audience's social class (e.g., a courtly opera performed for peasants might be poorly received).\n>\n> **C. Intimidate**\n> *   Gain a **+10 bonus** when using Intimidate on a character of a lower Status (Tier or Standing).\n>\n> **D. Gossip**\n> *   Suffer a **-10 penalty** to Gossip Tests made between characters of different Tiers.\n>\n> **E. Leadership**\n> *   Gain a **+10 bonus** when using Leadership on characters of a lower Tier.\n> *   Gain a **+20 bonus** when using Leadership on characters two Tiers lower than you.\n\n---\n\n**VI. Maintaining Your Status**\n\n> **A. Keeping Up Appearances**\n> > To benefit from your Status, you must act the part. This includes spending a certain amount of money to maintain your lifestyle.\n> > *   **Failing to Spend:** If you fail to meet the expected expenditure for your Tier, you lose **1 point of Standing per week**.\n> > *   **Dropping a Tier:** If your Standing drops to 0, your Tier is reduced by one, and your Standing is reset to 5 (e.g., Gold 1 becomes Silver 5). If you are already Brass 1, your Status becomes Brass 0.\n> > *   **Regaining Status:** Once you resume spending appropriately, you regain **1 point of Standing per week** until you return to your original level.\n>\n> **B. Going Incognito**\n> > If you choose to hide your identity and act as a commoner, you are treated as having a Status of **Brass 3** for all social interactions.\n\n---\n\n**VII. Earning Money with Status**\n\n> Your Status directly impacts your earning potential. You can spend a week working in your career (an activity called **Earning**) to generate income.\n>\n> **A. The Earning Test**\n> > Make an **Average (+20) Dramatic Test** using your career's designated Earning Skill (the one marked in italics at Level 1).\n> > *   **Success:** You earn the full amount listed below.\n> > *   **Failure:** You earn half the amount.\n> > *   **Astounding Failure (-6 SL or more):** You earn nothing.\n>\n> **B. Income Table**\n> > The amount earned is calculated by multiplying the base amount for your Tier by your current Standing.\n>\n> | Tier | Base Amount Earned (per point of Standing) |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | **Brass** | 2d10 Brass Pennies |\n> | **Silver** | 1d10 Silver Shillings |\n> | **Gold** | 1 Gold Crown |\n>\n> *   **Example:** A character with a Status of Silver 3 would roll 3d10 and receive the result in Silver Shillings.\n\n---\n\n**VIII. Optional Rule: NPC Reactions to Status**\n\n> To add unpredictability to social encounters, the GM can roll 1d10 to determine an NPC's attitude towards social conventions.\n>\n> | 1d10 Roll | Result | Effect |\n> | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n> | 1–2 | **Defies Status** | The NPC ignores all Status modifiers, treating everyone as an equal. |\n> | 3–8 | **Standard Reactions** | The NPC follows the normal rules for Status. |\n> | 9–10 | **Extreme Views** | The NPC holds extreme views. All Status-based modifiers are increased by an additional +/-10 (e.g., a +10 bonus becomes +20). This could also mean they react negatively to those of higher status. |\n",

This document is intended to be used alongside the core spellcasting SOPs.\n\n---\n\n**I. Spell Delivery**\n\n*   **Magic Missile:**\n    *   **Hit Location:** Determined by reversing the digits of the successful Language (Magick) Test roll.\n    *   **Damage:** `Spell's Base Damage + SL of Casting Test + Caster's Willpower Bonus`.\n    *   **Reduction:** Damage is reduced by the target's Toughness Bonus and Armour Points as normal.\n*   **Touch Spells (in Combat):**\n    *   To touch an unwilling target, you must first succeed on the Casting Test.\n    *   Then, as part of the same action, you must win an **Opposed Melee (Brawling) Test** against the target.\n    *   If the touch spell is also a magic missile, the Hit Location is determined by the result of the Melee (Brawling) Test, not the casting roll.\n\n---\n\n**II. Casting Modifiers & Limitations**\n\n*   **Armour Penalties:**\n    *   Suffer a **-1 SL penalty** to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point on your most heavily armoured location.\n    *   *Exception:* Wizards with *Arcane Magic (Metal)* ignore penalties from metal armour.\n    *   *Exception:* Wizards with *Arcane Magic (Beasts)* ignore penalties from leather armour.\n*   **Inappropriate Garb:**\n    *   Suffer a **-1 SL penalty** if dressed in colours or materials anathema to your chosen Wind.\n*   **Advantage:**\n    *   You **can** spend Advantage on Casting Tests.\n    *   You **cannot** spend Advantage on Channelling Tests.\n    *   You gain **+1 Advantage** if your target has already been affected by a spell from the same Lore this round.\n*   **General Limitations:**\n    *   **Speech:** You must be able to speak clearly. Being gagged or underwater increases the difficulty.\n    *   **Line of Sight:** You must be able to see your target unless the spell specifies otherwise.\n    *   **Stacking:** Spell effects do not stack. A target only benefits from the single best bonus and suffers from the single worst penalty of any given type.\n    *   **One at a Time:** You cannot have the same spell in effect more than once.\n\n---\n\n**III. Overcasting Options**\n\n> When you succeed on a Casting Test, for every **+2 SL** you achieve above the spell's required CN, you may choose one enhancement. You may choose the same option multiple times. The specific enhancements available are detailed in the **`overcasting_options.json`** data file.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Special Rules & Conditions**\n\n*   **Malignant Influences (Corruption):**\n    *   When casting or channelling near a Corrupting Influence, any test roll where the units die is an **8** results in a **Minor Miscast**.\n    *   If the test already triggered a Minor Miscast, it is escalated to a **Major Miscast**.\n*   **Using Ingredients:**\n    *   Using a spell-specific ingredient reduces a **Major Miscast** to a **Minor Miscast**, and negates a **Minor Miscast** entirely.\n    *   The ingredient is always consumed.\n*   **Using Warpstone:**\n    *   Using a fragment of Warpstone **doubles the SL** achieved on a Casting or Channelling Test.\n    *   Using Warpstone is a Corrupting Influence and automatically triggers the **Malignant Influences** rule.\n",

            "content": "### **`Cheat Sheet: Core Tests`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide the foundational rules for performing all d100-based tests, including the method for calculating Success Level (SL) and interpreting the final outcome.\n\n---\n\n**I. The Test Resolution Procedure**\n\nAll standard tests in the game follow this four-step process.\n\n**1. Determine Difficulty & Final Target Number**\n> Before any roll, the GM assigns a difficulty to the task. This difficulty provides a modifier that is applied to your base Skill or Characteristic value. The standard modifiers for each difficulty level are defined in the **`test_difficulty_table.json`** file.\n>\n> *   **Formula:** `Final Target Number = Base Skill/Characteristic + Difficulty Modifier`\n> *   *Example: A character with a `Melee (Basic)` of 45 attempts a `Hard (-20)` attack. The Final Target Number is 45 - 20 = 25.*\n\n**2. Roll 1d100**\n> Make the roll to get your result.\n> *   *Example: The roll is 18.*\n\n**3. Determine Success or Failure**\n> Compare the roll to the Final Target Number.\n> *   If **Roll ≤ Final Target Number**, it is a **Success**. (e.g., 18 ≤ 25, so it's a Success).\n> *   If **Roll > Final Target Number**, it is a **Failure**.\n\n**4. Calculate Success Level (The Tens Digit Rule)**\n> The Success Level (SL) measures the quality of your success or failure. It is calculated by subtracting the **tens digit of the Roll** from the **tens digit of the Final Target Number**.\n>\n> *   **Worked Example:**\n>     *   Final Target Number: **2**5 (The tens digit is **2**)\n>     *   d100 Roll: **1**8 (The tens digit is **1**)\n>     *   **Calculation:** 2 - 1 = **+1 SL**\n\n---\n\n**II. Interpreting the Outcome**\n\n> The calculated SL determines the narrative quality of the result. The specific outcomes for each SL range are defined in the **`outcome_table.json`** file.\n>\n> | Success Level (SL) | Outcome |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | **+6 or more** | Astounding Success |\n> | **+4 to +5** | Impressive Success |\n> | **+2 to +3** | Success |\n> | **+0 to +1** | Marginal Success |\n> | **-0 to -1** | Marginal Failure |\n> | **-2 to -3** | Failure |\n> | **-4 to -5** | Impressive Failure |\n> | **-6 or less** | Astounding Failure |\n\n---\n\n**III. Special Results (High-Stakes Rules)**\n\n**A. Automatic Outcomes (Dice Extremes)**\n> These results are absolute and override skill, modifiers, and the normal success/failure state of the roll.\n\n*   **Automatic Critical Success:** A roll of **01, 02, 03, 04, or 05** is **always** a Critical Success, regardless of whether the roll was high enough to fail.\n*   **Automatic Fumble:** A roll of **96, 97, 98, 99, or 100** is **always** a Fumble, regardless of whether the roll was low enough to succeed.\n\n**B. Conditional Triggers**\n> These results only trigger if the test has already been determined to be a success or failure and did not trigger an Automatic Outcome.\n>\n> **Definition of a Double:** A \"double\" is a d100 roll where the tens digit and the units digit are identical (e.g., 11, 22, 33). A roll of '100' is not considered a double for this purpose.\n\n*   **Conditional Critical:** A test that is a **Success** also becomes a Critical if the roll is a **double** (e.g., 11, 22, 33, 44, 55).\n*   **Conditional Fumble:** A test that is a **Failure** also becomes a Fumble if:\n    *   The roll is a **double** (e.g., 66, 77, 88, 99).\n    *   The final result is an **Astounding Failure** (-6 SL or worse).\n\n---\n\n**IV. Opposed Test Special Results**\n\n> When both participants in an Opposed Test trigger a special result, use the following rules to determine the outcome.\n\n**A. Critical vs. Critical**\n> *   **Rule:** The combatant with the **higher Success Level (SL)** wins the Opposed Test. Their Critical takes effect as normal. The loser's Critical is ignored, though they still count as having succeeded at their roll for the purpose of the SL calculation.\n> *   **Narrative:** This represents a masterful exchange where a brilliant attack is met with a perfect defense, but one combatant's superior skill finds a momentary, decisive opening.\n\n**B. Fumble vs. Fumble**\n> *   **Rule:** Both combatants' Fumbles take effect. Roll on the appropriate Fumble table for each character involved.\n> *   **Narrative:** This represents a moment of pure, chaotic incompetence. Both combatants stumble, over-commit, or otherwise fail spectacularly and simultaneously, leading to a messy and often comical outcome.\n\n**C. Critical vs. Fumble**\n> *   **Rule:** Both effects trigger. The character who scored the Critical resolves it as normal. The character who Fumbled also resolves their Fumble as normal.\n> *   **Narrative:** This is the most decisive outcome. One character's perfect execution is amplified by their opponent's catastrophic failure. The defender doesn't just fail to block; they actively create an opening that makes the attack even more devastating.\n",
