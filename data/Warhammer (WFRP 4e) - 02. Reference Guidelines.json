            "content": "### **`Guideline: Game State & Flow Management`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To define the core operational loops of the game, managing the transitions between the three primary states of play—**Narrative Mode**, **Combat Mode**, and **Downtime Mode**—with a high degree of procedural detail.\n\n---\n\n**I. Core Philosophy: The Golden Rule**\n\n> The rules exist to facilitate epic stories in the Warhammer world and should never be a barrier to fun. This principle encourages flexibility, but should not be confused with avoiding all negative outcomes. A sense of risk and the real possibility of failure are central to drama and provide the meaningful challenges that define a hero's journey.\n>\n> To maintain narrative momentum, if a situation becomes mechanically repetitive with a foregone conclusion (such as a helpless, `Broken` enemy repeatedly failing to flee), the GM should make a narrative declaration to resolve the situation instead of calling for further rolls.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Three Game States**\n\n> The game operates in one of three distinct modes, each with its own structure and pace:\n>\n> *   **Narrative Mode:** The default state for exploration, investigation, and social interaction. Time is fluid.\n> *   **Combat Mode:** A structured state where time is measured in Rounds and Turns. Used for resolving violent conflict.\n> *   **Downtime Mode:** A structured state for handling the passage of weeks or months between adventures.\n\n---\n\n**III. Narrative Mode**\n\n> **A. Core Loop**\n> 1.  **Scene Setting:** The GM presents the situation using the `Report: Story Narrative Response`.\n> 2.  **Player Declaration:** You declare your intended action(s).\n> 3.  **Action Resolution:** The system determines the outcome using the logic below. If a test is required, it is resolved according to the `Cheat Sheet: Core Tests`.\n> 4.  **Outcome Reporting:** The result is delivered via the relevant report (e.g., `Report: Action Resolution Outcome (WFRP)`).\n> 5.  **Narrative Consolidation:** The GM generates a new `Report: Story Narrative Response` describing the evolving scene. Appended to this response, within `<details>` tags, will be the `Report: Narrative Turn Summary`, which logs all key discoveries and status changes from the preceding action.\n> 6.  The loop repeats from Step 2.\n>\n> **B. Determining the Resolution Method**\n> > When an action with an uncertain outcome is declared, the following logic is used:\n> > 1.  **Is the outcome narratively important, exciting, or dramatic?**\n> >     *   **If NO:** The GM must decide if the outcome needs to be random.\n> >         *   **If YES:** A **Simple Test** is made.\n> >         *   **If NO:** The **GM decides** the outcome based on the character's abilities and the situation, without a roll.\n> >     *   **If YES:** The GM must decide if the *degree* of success or failure matters.\n> >         *   **If YES:** A **Dramatic Test** is made.\n> >         *   **If NO:** A **Simple Test** is made.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Combat Mode**\n\n> **A. Core Loop**\n> 1.  **Round Begins:** The GM announces the start of a new round. Any \"start of the round\" effects trigger.\n> 2.  **Turn Start:** The GM generates a `Report: Combat Turn Start (WFRP)` for the current combatant.\n> 3.  **Action Declaration & Resolution:** The active combatant declares their action. The system resolves it using the **Detailed Action Resolution Process** below.\n> 4.  **Turn End:** The GM generates a `Report: Combat Turn End` to summarize the turn's results.\n> 5.  The loop repeats from Step 2 for the next combatant in the initiative order.\n> 6.  **Round End:** Once all combatants have taken a turn, the GM generates a `Report: Combat Round Summary`. The loop then repeats from Step 1.\n>\n> **B. Detailed Action Resolution Process**\n> > When an action is declared, it is resolved in a sequence that culminates in a single, final report.\n> >\n> > 1.  **Assess Modifiers:** Before any roll, the system must consult the `combat_difficulty_table.json` and apply any relevant modifiers based on the current tactical situation, including the target's Conditions (e.g., `Broken`, `Prone`, `Surprised`).\n> > 2.  **Preliminary Resolution (if applicable):** For complex actions like spellcasting or prayers, a preliminary report (e.g., `Report: Spellcasting Outcome (WFRP)`) is generated first to resolve the initial test and its unique consequences (like Miscasts).\n> > 3.  **Final Consolidation:** The results of the action, including any preliminary reports, are consolidated to determine the final outcome (damage, conditions, narrative description, etc.).\n> > 4.  **Final Report:** This consolidated outcome is presented in a single, comprehensive **`Report: Action Resolution Outcome (WFRP)`**.\n\n---\n\n**V. Downtime Mode (Report-Driven Flow)**\n> *This section remains unchanged.*\n\n---\n\n**VI. State Transitions**\n> *This section remains unchanged.*\n```\n",

            "content": "### **`Guideline: Between Adventures (Downtime)`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To establish the rules and procedures for managing the period between adventures, known as 'downtime'. This includes random events, managing finances, and undertaking personal activities (Endeavours).\n\n---\n\n**I. Core Philosophy: An Optional Framework**\n\n> As stated in the source material, every rule in this chapter is optional. This system provides a structured way to handle the passage of time and character activities between major adventures. It can be used for:\n> *   **Quick Resolution:** To swiftly determine what happens during downtime without extensive roleplaying.\n> *   **Roleplaying Inspiration:** To generate hooks, events, and personal story arcs that can be explored in greater detail, potentially leading to new adventures.\n>\n> The ultimate goal is to provide a flexible toolkit that can be adapted to the needs of the story and the preferences of the players.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Downtime Sequence**\n\n> When an adventure concludes and a period of downtime begins, we will follow this structured sequence:\n>\n> **1. The Event Phase**\n> > The first step is to determine if a significant, unexpected event occurs. This is resolved by rolling **1d100** on the `Events Table`. The outcome may affect a single character or the entire party.\n>\n> **2. The Spending Phase**\n> > After resolving the Event, characters have the opportunity to spend any money they acquired on their last escapade using the normal rules for purchasing goods and services.\n>\n> **3. The Endeavours Phase**\n> > Characters may then engage in a variety of activities called **Endeavours**. These represent how they spend the majority of their downtime and can range from commonplace tasks (like working a trade) to more specialised undertakings (like research or training).\n>\n> **4. The Resolution Phase**\n> > Once all Endeavours are chosen and their outcomes determined, we will resolve any final matters, including the \"Money to Burn\" rule.\n>\n> **5. Begin Next Adventure**\n> > With the downtime period fully resolved, the characters are now ready to embark on their next adventure, carrying with them the consequences and rewards of their time off.\n\n---\n\n**III. Events Table**\n\n> *To be rolled once at the beginning of the downtime period.*\n>\n> | d100 Roll | Event | Description |\n> | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n> | **01–03** | **Accused Ally** | An ally is implicated in a crime. Freeing them requires a successful **Average (+20) Lore (Law) Test** (1 Endeavour) or **3 party Endeavours**. Success grants a Major Favour; failure results in the ally's execution. |\n> | **04–06** | **Arcane Auction** | A dusty book is available for **10 GC**. If purchased, Academic characters gain **+20** to Research Lore Endeavours. |\n> | **07–10** | **Betrayed!** | A friend, family member, or ally turns on you. The consequences will affect the next adventure. |\n> | **11–14** | **Bolt from the Blue** | Your mount has bolted. An **Average (+20) Animal Training (Horse) Test** will bring it back. Failure means it's gone for good. No mount? You get a painful blister instead. |\n> | **15–18** | **Oi! You spilled my pint!** | You've started a feud with a local who will seek petty revenge during the next adventure. |\n> | **19–21** | **Crime Crackdown** | The Watch is vigilant. Rogues cannot use the Income Endeavour. Banking Endeavours for Rogues are restricted to High-risk deposits only. |\n> | **22–25** | **The Exciseman Cometh** | A tax collector arrives. All characters lose **30%** of their current funds. |\n> | **26–29** | **False Silver** | Counterfeit coins are circulating. All money banked or earned from Income Endeavours is reduced by **20%**. |\n> | **30–33** | **Flowing Profit** | Riverfolk characters earn **+50%** from any Income Endeavour this downtime. |\n> | **34–36** | **Forewarned is Forearmed** | A cryptic omen increases your maximum Fortune points by **1** for the next adventure. |\n> | **37–40** | **Festivities** | A local celebration occurs. You get caught up in it and lose **one Endeavour**. |\n> | **41–44** | **Inclement Weather** | Bad weather imposes a **-10 penalty** to all social Skill Tests and increases food prices by **20%** for the next adventure. |\n> | **45–48** | **Glorious Weather** | You are inspired and may add one new Short-term Ambition. This ambition is not replaced upon completion. |\n> | **49–52** | **Local Crop Failure** | Food is scarce. Peasant class characters cannot use the Income Endeavour, and food prices are doubled for the next adventure. |\n> | **53–56** | **Malicious Malady** | The Bloody Flux is in town. Make an **Easy (+40) Toughness Test**. Failure means you contract the disease. |\n> | **57–60** | **Monstrous Complications** | A monster terrorizes the area, halting all Income Endeavours. The party can sacrifice **one Endeavour each** to fight it. Success grants a free Income Endeavour each and a feast. |\n> | **61–63** | **Morr’s Embrace** | A relative, friend, or ally dies. The circumstances may be suspicious. |\n> | **64–65** | **New Moon** | The dark nights benefit illicit activities. Rogue characters earn **+20%** from the Income Endeavour. |\n> | **66–67** | **Old Debts** | A Major or Significant Favour is called in. This will be part of the next adventure, and you lose **one Endeavour** in preparation. |\n> | **68–69** | **Opportunity Saunters Through** | Wealthy travellers are in the area. Burgher and Peasant class characters earn **+50%** from the Income Endeavour. |\n> | **70–71** | **Peace and Quiet** | You enjoy a blissfully uneventful downtime. |\n> | **72–73** | **Pedlar** | For 3d, a gossipy pedlar grants you **+10** to any Latest News Endeavours. |\n> | **74–76** | **Pestilential Pet** | Your animal is sick. A **Challenging (+0) Animal Care Test** determines if it survives. No animals? You are troubled by ill omens instead. |\n> | **77–79** | **Ransacked** | Your stash is raided and all your money is stolen. If you had less than 1 GC, your most valuable trapping is taken instead. |\n> | **80–82** | **Riots** | The common folk are angry. Courtier class characters cannot use the Income Endeavour. Reputable banks may go out of business. Foment Dissent Endeavours gain **+10** to related tests. |\n> | **83–85** | **Sticky Fingers** | Your purse is cut. You lose **half** of your money. |\n> | **86–88** | **Suspicion of Heresy** | A Witch Hunter suspects you. A **Very Hard (-30) Charm Test** is required to prove your innocence. Failure earns you a powerful nemesis. |\n> | **89–91** | **Under Suspicion** | Your activities have drawn unwanted attention. All characters lose **one Endeavour** laying low. Rogues cannot use the Income Endeavour. |\n> | **92–94** | **Uneventful** | Little of interest occurs. |\n> | **95–97** | **Unexpected Esteem** | A past good deed is repaid with an appropriate reward (item, money, etc.). |\n> | **98–00** | **Unusual Mercenaries** | Rare mercenaries are in town. They offer training in martial Skills/Talents at a **20% XP discount**. Combat Training Endeavours gain a **+20 bonus** to relevant tests. |\n\n---\n\n**IV. The Endeavours Phase: Core Rules**\n\n> **A. Endeavour Limits**\n> *   You may undertake a maximum of **one Endeavour per week** you are not adventuring.\n> *   You may attempt a maximum of **three Endeavours in total**, regardless of how long the gap between adventures may be.\n> *   The rest of your time is assumed to be spent living your life, dealing with mundane tasks, and recuperating.\n>\n> **B. The \"Money to Burn\" Rule**\n> *   This is a critical rule for the downtime economy. After you have completed all your Endeavours, **all money your character is currently holding is considered gone.**\n> *   This represents the accumulated costs of living, taxes, debts, repairs, bribes, carousing, charitable donations, or simply having it stolen. You are encouraged to narrate how your character's funds disappeared.\n> *   To preserve wealth for future adventures, you **must** use the **Banking Endeavour**.\n> *   To start the next adventure with funds, you **must** use the **Income Endeavour**.\n>\n> **C. Duties & Responsibilities (Career Obligations)**\n> *   This rule applies to characters who have reached the **third or fourth level** of their Career Path.\n> *   **The Obligation:** To reflect the responsibilities of your high status (managing estates, overseeing a guild, leading a watch, etc.), you are expected to perform your duties. This is mechanically represented by undertaking the **Income Endeavour**.\n> *   **The Consequence:** If you are in Career Level 3 or 4 and **do not** take the Income Endeavour during downtime, you neglect your duties and **drop one Career Level** (e.g., from Level 4 to 3, or Level 3 to 2).\n>     *   This is a free, downward career change (no XP cost).\n>     *   Your Status and potential earnings are lowered accordingly.\n>     *   You do **not** lose any previously purchased Advances.\n>     *   To regain your former position, you must pay the XP cost to re-enter the higher Career Level.\n>\n**D. Species-Specific Obligations (Elf Esteem)**\n*   **The Obligation:** All Elven characters are expected to maintain their cultural connections and responsibilities to their kin, whether it be reporting to spies from Athel Loren or agents of Ulthuan. This is a narrative requirement reflecting the long-game politics and psyche of the Elven race.\n*   **The Trigger Condition:** This obligation is only enforced during extended periods of downtime.\n    *   An Elf **must** fulfill this obligation **if, and only if,** the downtime period is long enough to grant them the maximum of **three (3) Endeavours**.\n    *   If the downtime period is shorter (granting only 1 or 2 Endeavours), this obligation does not apply.\n*   **The Endeavour:** When the condition is met, the character must spend **one Endeavour** to fulfill this duty. This Endeavour is narrative in nature and offers no direct mechanical advantage. It represents the time and effort spent maintaining ties that Elves consider essential.\n\n---\n\n**V. List of General Endeavours**\n\n> *These Endeavours can be undertaken by any character. They are designed for individuals but can be adapted into group roleplaying scenes and may serve as hooks for new adventures.*\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **1. Animal Training**\n> *   **Purpose:** To train one of your animals in a new skill.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and make an **Average (+20) Animal Training Test**.\n> *   **Outcome:** If successful, you may add one skill to your animal from the \"Trained Creature\" Trait list.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **2. Banking**\n> *   **Purpose:** To store your money and prevent it from being lost due to the \"Money to Burn\" rule.\n> *   **Process:** You must choose one of two methods:\n>\n>     **A. Investing with a Bank**\n>     *   **Requirements:** You must have a Status of Silver or Gold.\n>     *   **Deposit (Costs 1 Endeavour):** You deposit your funds. You must choose or roll a 1d10 to determine your **Interest Rate**. This number represents both the percentage interest you will earn and the percentage chance your investment will fail.\n>     *   **Withdrawal (Costs 1 Endeavour):** To withdraw your money, roll 1d100.\n>         *   **Success:** If your roll is **higher** than your Interest Rate, you receive your initial deposit plus the accrued interest.\n>         *   **Failure:** If your roll is **equal to or lower than** your Interest Rate, the bank has gone bankrupt and you lose all your money.\n>\n>     **B. Stashing Your Loot**\n>     *   **Requirements:** Any character can use this method.\n>     *   **Deposit (Costs 1 Endeavour):** You hide your money in a secret location. It does not accrue interest.\n>     *   **Withdrawal (Costs 0 Endeavours):** Before the start of any future adventure, you can attempt to retrieve your stash. Roll 1d100.\n>         *   **Success:** If you roll **higher than 10**, you recover all your funds.\n>         *   **Failure:** If you roll **10 or lower**, your stash has been discovered and all your money is gone.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **3. Changing Career**\n> *   **Purpose:** To transition to a new Career path.\n> *   **Requirements:** You must have GM approval for a story-appropriate change.\n> *   **Process & Cost:**\n>     *   If you have **completed** your current Career Level, you may move to the new Career for **free**.\n>     *   If you have **not completed** your current Career Level, this Endeavour costs **100 XP**.\n> *   **Narrative:** This Endeavour represents the time spent networking, acquiring licenses, paying bribes, and making the necessary arrangements for your new life.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **4. Commission**\n> *   **Purpose:** To order an item of **Exotic** rarity or arrange for the creation of a unique, specialized item.\n> *   **Requirements:** You must know a source capable of acquiring or manufacturing the item. If you do not, you must first undertake the **Consult an Expert** Endeavour.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour, pay the required cost for the item, and place your order.\n> *   **Outcome:** The commissioned item will be ready for collection *after* your next adventure. You may only commission one Exotic item per Endeavour.\n> *   **Special Note on Custom Gear:** With GM permission, you may undertake **two or more consecutive Commission Endeavours** to acquire truly exceptional items (e.g., Engineer's Guild prototypes, rare poisons, enchanted items). The cost for such projects will be extremely high and may require undertaking Favours or entire adventures to secure materials.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **5. Consult an Expert**\n> *   **Purpose:** To find a source for another Endeavour (like Commission or Training) or to acquire a specific piece of obscure knowledge.\n> *   **Process:** This Endeavour has two stages.\n>     1.  **Locate the Expert:** Attempt a **Challenging (+0) Gossip Test** (difficulty may vary by location).\n>         *   **Success:** You find a legitimate expert.\n>         *   **Failure:** You find a loud, self-proclaimed \"specialist.\" You may choose to deal with this questionable source or not.\n>         *   *(This stage can be skipped if you already know an appropriate expert.)*\n>     2.  **Consult the Expert:** You must convince the expert to share their knowledge. This may require anything from a **Simple Charm Test** to owing them a significant **Favour**, depending on the complexity and danger of the information sought.\n> *   **Outcome (for seeking knowledge):** If successful, you gain the information you sought, colored by the expert's biases. You also gain one **Expert Reroll**, which can be used on a single Test directly related to the lore you learned. This reroll must be used before the end of your next adventure.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **6. Crafting**\n> *   **Purpose:** To personally create trappings and items using your Trade Skills.\n> *   **Requirements:** Appropriate Trade Skill, Tools, Workshop, and Raw Materials (costing 1/4 of the item's list price).\n> *   **Process:** This is an **Extended Trade Test**. Each Endeavour spent allows one roll.\n>     *   **Difficulty:** Set by the item's Availability.\n>         *   Common: **Average (+20)**\n>         *   Scarce: **Challenging (+0)**\n>         *   Rare: **Difficult (–10)**\n>         *   Exotic: **Very Hard (–30)**\n>     *   **Required SL:** Determined by the item's value.\n>         *   Brass Price: **5 SL**\n>         *   Silver Price: **10 SL**\n>         *   Gold Price: **15+ SL**\n>     *   **Modifiers:** Adding a **Flaw** to the item halves the required SL. Adding a **Quality** adds +5 SL (calculated after halving for flaws).\n> *   **Outcome:** Once the required SL is accumulated, the item is successfully crafted.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **7. Do Me a Favour! (Paying Off a Debt)**\n> *   **Purpose:** To use your downtime to repay a Minor or Major Favour you already owe to an NPC, thus clearing your obligation.\n>\n>     **A. The Nature of Favours**\n>     *   A Favour is a future burden you accept in return for immediate assistance. Breaking a sworn oath is a serious matter.\n>     *   **Consequences of Refusal:** Refusing to repay a Favour when called upon reduces your **Status by 1 level**. Furthermore, the slighted NPC will likely seek their own form of retribution.\n>\n>     **B. Levels of Favours**\n>     *   Favours are categorized by their severity and the effort required to repay them.\n>     *   **Minor Favour:** A simple task requiring a few hours (e.g., putting in a good word, volunteering at a temple).\n>     *   **Major Favour:** A time-consuming or risky task that could take weeks and involve travel (e.g., acting as a lookout for a heist, transporting a package to another city).\n>     *   **Significant Favour:** A very rare and dangerous obligation that will almost certainly involve risking life and limb and will be played out as a full adventure (e.g., eliminating a rival gang leader, wiping out a greenskin warband).\n>\n>     **C. The Endeavour Process**\n>     *   With GM permission, you can spend Endeavours to repay outstanding Favours.\n>     *   **To repay a Minor Favour:** Costs **1 Endeavour**.\n>     *   **To repay a Major Favour:** Costs **2 or more consecutive Endeavours**.\n>     *   **Significant Favours cannot be repaid with Endeavours.** They must be resolved through roleplaying an adventure.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **8. Income**\n> *   **Purpose:** To generate the funds you will start the *next* adventure with, and to fulfill professional obligations.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and narrate how your character earns their keep (e.g., a Bounty Hunter collects a bounty, a Noble manages their estate).\n> *   **Outcome:**\n>     *   **Money:** You receive your standard income as determined by your Status. This money is given to you *after* all money from the previous adventure is lost via the \"Money to Burn\" rule.\n>     *   **Career Maintenance:** If you are in the third or fourth level of your Career, undertaking this Endeavour successfully maintains your position and prevents you from dropping a Career Level.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **9. Invent!**\n> *   **Purpose:** To invent entirely new trappings by combining existing ones. This is a two-stage process.\n> *   **Stage 1: Plan (Costs 1 Endeavour)**\n>     *   **Process:** Decide which trappings you want to combine. Make a **Trade (Engineer) Test**, with the difficulty set by the GM based on how outlandish the idea is.\n>     *   **Outcome:** On a success, you create the blueprints. Each SL scored on this test adds a cumulative +1 SL to the subsequent *Build* attempt.\n> *   **Stage 2: Build (Requires a new Endeavour)**\n>     *   You must use either a **Crafting** or **Commission** Endeavour to build the invention.\n>     *   **If Crafting:** You must have all the relevant Trade Skills. The test is always **Very Hard (–30)**. Raw materials cost **twice** the listed price of the combined components.\n>     *   **If Commissioning:** You will likely need a **Consult an Expert** Endeavour first. The commission will cost **six times** the listed price of the combined components.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **10. Training**\n> *   **Purpose:** To learn a Skill or advance a Characteristic that is *outside* of your current Career path, treating it as if it were in-career for XP cost purposes.\n> *   **Requirements:** You must find a suitable tutor. For obscure or illicit skills (like certain Lores), this will likely require a **Consult an Expert** Endeavour first and may involve significant risk or owing a Favour.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour, pay the XP cost for the advance, and pay the tutor's fee.\n> *   **Tutor's Fee:**\n>     *   Basic Skills & Characteristics: **1d10 brass pennies** per XP spent.\n>     *   Advanced Skills: **Double** the above cost.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **11. Unusual Learning**\n> *   **Purpose:** To attempt to learn a Talent that is *outside* of your current Career path. Success is not guaranteed.\n> *   **Requirements:** You must have an appropriate tutor, which may require a **Consult an Expert** Endeavour.\n> *   **Process:**\n>     1.  Spend one Endeavour.\n>     2.  Pay the tutor's fee of **2d10 silver shillings per 100 XP** the Talent costs.\n>     3.  Attempt a **Hard (-20) Test** using the most relevant Skill or Characteristic (GM's discretion).\n> *   **Outcome:**\n>     *   **Success:** You learn the Talent and pay the XP cost.\n>     *   **Failure:** You do not learn the Talent. The XP and money are spent to no avail. However, you gain a cumulative **+10 bonus** to future attempts to learn this specific Talent.\n\n---\n\n**VI. List of Class Endeavours**\n\n> *These Endeavours are tailored to specific Classes. Any character may attempt them, but if you do not belong to one of the specified Classes, any associated Tests are **one Difficulty Level harder** (e.g., Challenging becomes Difficult, Average becomes Challenging).*\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **1. Combat Training**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Rangers, Warriors\n> *   **Purpose:** To hone your martial skills between battles.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and make a **Challenging (+0) Test** using a Melee or Ranged Skill you possess.\n> *   **Outcome:** If successful, you gain one **Reversal Token** for that specific skill. This allows you to reverse the digits of a single failed test using that skill during your next adventure, potentially turning it into a success. You can undertake this Endeavour multiple times.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **2. Foment Dissent**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Burghers, Peasants\n> *   **Purpose:** To sow civil unrest and turn public opinion against a specific target.\n> *   **Process:** This Endeavour costs **two Endeavours** to attempt.\n>     1.  Make an **Average (+20) Gossip Test** to understand the local political landscape.\n>     2.  If successful, make a **Charm Test** to rile up the populace. The difficulty depends on the target's popularity (e.g., Easy for an oppressive noble, Hard for a beloved charity).\n> *   **Outcome:** If both tests succeed, you have successfully primed a mob. During your next adventure, you can make a Charm Test to gather this mob to accost your target. A simple success leads to shouting and throwing vegetables; an Impressive or Astounding Success could lead to a lynch mob. Failure on either of the initial tests means the Endeavour fails, and a significant failure might alert your target to your activities.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **3. The Latest News**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Rangers, Riverfolk\n> *   **Purpose:** To gather rumours and information from distant lands.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and make a **Challenging (+0) Gossip Test**.\n> *   **Outcome:** On a success, you learn one interesting rumour. Each additional SL grants another rumour. On an Impressive Failure, you learn a false rumour that you believe to be true (the GM may roll this in secret).\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **4. Reputation**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Academics, Burghers, Courtiers\n> *   **Purpose:** To temporarily increase your social Standing by spending money and influence.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour. You must pay an amount of money equal to your maximum potential earnings from the Income Endeavour. Then, make a **Challenging (+0) Test** using a relevant Career Skill.\n> *   **Outcome:**\n>     *   **Success:** Your Standing increases by **+1** for the duration of the next adventure.\n>     *   **Astounding Success (+6 SL):** Your Standing increases by **+2**.\n>     *   **Failure:** The money is wasted with no effect.\n>     *   **Astounding Failure (–6 SL):** Your efforts backfire, and your Standing *decreases* by **-1** for the duration of the next adventure.\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **5. Research Lore**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Academics\n> *   **Purpose:** To uncover specific information about a person, place, or event.\n> *   **Requirements:** Access to a library, archive, or other repository of knowledge.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and make a Test.\n>     *   If you have the appropriate **Lore Specialisation**, it is an **Average (+20) Lore Test**.\n>     *   If you are literate but lack the specialisation, it is a **Difficult (–10) Intelligence Test**.\n> *   **Outcome:** On a success, you learn one useful piece of information. Each additional SL grants another piece of information. On an Impressive or Astounding Failure, you learn something false that you believe to be true (the GM may roll this in secret).\n>\n> ---\n>\n> **6. Study a Mark**\n> *   **Associated Classes:** Rogues\n> *   **Purpose:** To observe a potential target for a future crime, learning their habits and weaknesses.\n> *   **Process:** Spend one Endeavour and make a **Challenging (+0) Perception Test**.\n> *   **Outcome:** If successful, you gain one **Reversal Token** that can be used on any one Test made concerning that specific mark during your next adventure. The GM will also provide information about the mark based on your SL. You can undertake this Endeavour multiple times.",

            "content": "### **`Guideline: Skills & Talents (WFRP)`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To establish the foundational rules for how Skills and Talents function, are acquired, and are used within the game system. This document serves as a core reference for the Architect persona.\n\n---\n\n**I. Core Skill Principles**\n\n> **A. Determining Skill Level**\n> *   A Skill's rating is calculated by adding the number of Advances taken in that Skill to its associated Characteristic.\n> *   **Formula:** `Skill Rating = Associated Characteristic + Number of Advances`\n>\n> **B. Basic vs. Advanced Skills**\n> *   **Basic Skills:** Represent common abilities. These can be tested even if a character has zero Advances in them. In such cases, the test is made against the raw associated Characteristic.\n> *   **Advanced Skills:** Represent specialized training or knowledge. A character **must** have at least one Advance in an Advanced Skill to be able to perform a Test with it.\n>\n> **C. Grouped Skills & Specialisations**\n> *   Some skills are **Grouped**, meaning they are a broad category containing multiple related **Specialisations**.\n> *   When a character gains an Advance in a Grouped Skill, they must assign it to a specific Specialisation.\n> *   Each Specialisation is treated as its own unique skill.\n\n---\n\n**II. Complete Skill List**\n\n> **A. Basic Skills**\n> *   Art, Athletics, Bribery, Charm, Charm Animal, Climb, Cool, Consume Alcohol, Dodge, Drive, Endurance, Entertain, Gamble, Gossip, Haggle, Intimidate, Intuition, Leadership, Melee, Navigation, Outdoor Survival, Perception, Ride, Row, Stealth\n>\n> **B. Advanced Skills**\n> *   Animal Care, Animal Training, Channelling, Evaluate, Heal, Language, Lore, Perform, Pick Lock, Play, Pray, Ranged, Research, Sail, Secret Signs, Set Trap, Sleight of Hand, Swim, Track, Trade\n\n---\n\n**III. Core Talent Principles**\n\n> **A. Definition & Acquisition**\n> *   Talents represent special abilities, tricks, and quirks learned by a character, distinct from Skills and Characteristics.\n> *   They are acquired during character creation and can be purchased with Experience Points (XP) as allowed by a character's current Career path.\n>\n> **B. Multiple Ranks & Maximums**\n> *   Many Talents can be taken more than once, up to the maximum number specified in their \"Max\" field (e.g., \"Max: 1\" or \"Max: Toughness Bonus\").\n> *   The Talent's description will detail the effect of taking it multiple times.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Talent Mechanics**\n\n> **A. The +SL Bonus**\n> *   If a Talent's entry lists one or more skills under the \"Tests\" field, it provides a specific mechanical bonus.\n> *   **Rule:** For each time a character possesses such a Talent, they gain a bonus of **+1 SL** to any successful Test made using one of the associated skills. This bonus is cumulative.\n\n---",

We can always discuss rules interpretations or concerns OOC after the scene is resolved.\n>\n> *   **Drive the Story Forward:** Your actions should aim to progress the narrative and develop your character in interesting ways. Actively pursue your character's goals and ambitions.\n>\n> *   **Embrace the Narrative:** The goal is not \"winning,\" but telling a compelling story. This includes accepting setbacks and failures as opportunities for drama and character growth. Character death is a possibility; if it happens, we will work to make it a memorable and meaningful part of the story. Remember that running away is often the most heroic (and sensible) option.\n>\n> *   **Embrace Teamwork:** Even in a solo game with NPC allies, avoid being needlessly difficult or having your character wander off without a compelling story reason, as this can disrupt the narrative flow.\n>\n> *   **Share the Spotlight:** While you are the protagonist, allow NPC allies and other characters their moments to contribute to the story. This creates a richer and more believable world.\n\n---\n\n**II. Communication & Boundaries**\n\n> *   **Respect Boundaries:** The Old World is a dark and grim place. If any topic or theme becomes uncomfortable, please state so OOC. No justification is required. We will immediately adjust or steer away from the subject matter.\n>\n> *   **Clear Communication:** To avoid confusion between player intent and character action, please use OOC markers (like `(OOC: ...)` or `//...`) for any questions, clarifications, or meta-game discussions.\n>\n> *   **Prioritize Mutual Fun:** Our enjoyment of the game is a shared responsibility.

Core Principle: Random Rolls & Experience Points (XP)**\n> *   **Mechanic:** Throughout the creation process, the player will frequently have the option to either choose a specific outcome or accept the result of a random dice roll.\n> *   **Incentive:** Choosing to accept a random outcome is rewarded with bonus Experience Points (XP). These points are the primary resource for improving a character's abilities after creation.\n> *   **Function:** This system encourages players to embrace chance, potentially leading to more unexpected and unique character concepts, rewarding them with a head start on advancement.\n\n---\n\n**III. Step 1: Determine Species**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> The player has two options for determining their character's species:\n> > **1. Player's Choice (0 XP):** The player may freely choose their species from Human, Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, or Wood Elf.\n> > **2. Random Roll (+20 XP):**: The player may opt to roll 1d100 on the table below. If the player accepts the result, the character receives a bonus of **20 XP**.\n>\n> **B. Random Species Table**\n> | 1d100 Roll | Species |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | 01–90 | Human |\n> | 91–94 | Halfling |\n> | 95–98 | Dwarf |\n> | 99 | High Elf |\n> | 00 | Wood Elf |\n>\n> **C. Reference**\n> *(For full narrative and mechanical details of each species, refer to the `Reference: Human (Reiklander)`, `Reference: Dwarf`, etc. documents.)*\n\n---\n\n**IV. Step 2: Determine Class and Career**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> The player has several options for determining their Class and Career:\n> > **1. Single Random Roll (+50 XP):** Roll 1d100 on the Career Table. If accepted, gain **+50 XP**.\n> > **2. Three Random Rolls (+25 XP):** Roll three times and choose one. If one is accepted, gain **+25 XP**.\n> > **3. Player's Choice (0 XP):** Choose any Class and an available Career. No bonus XP.\n> > **4. Special Character Concepts (GM Discretion, 0 XP):** With GM approval, a player may choose a Species/Career combination not normally allowed. No bonus XP.\n>\n> **B. Reference**\n> *(For Class summaries and the full Random Class and Career Table, refer to the `Reference: Careers (WFRP 4e)` document.)*\n\n---\n\n**V. Step 3: Determine Attributes**\n> **A. Overview**\n> This step involves determining the character's core capabilities: their ten Characteristics, and their derived Attributes of Wounds, Fate, Resilience, and Movement.\n>\n> **B. Procedure - Characteristics**\n> The player has several options for determining their ten Characteristics, with different XP rewards based on the level of randomness accepted.\n> > **1. Pure Random Roll (+50 XP):** For each of the ten Characteristics, the GM rolls 2d10. The player must accept the rolls in the order they are made. Add the species modifier from the Attributes Table to each corresponding roll. If the player accepts this result without changes, the character gains a bonus of **50 XP**.\n> > **2. Rearranged Random Rolls (+25 XP):** The GM makes ten separate 2d10 rolls. The player may then assign each of these ten results to one of the ten Characteristics of their choice. Add the species modifier from the Attributes Table to each corresponding Characteristic. If the player accepts this result, the character gains a bonus of **25 XP**.\n> > **3. Player's Choice (0 XP):** If the player is unhappy with the random results, they may choose one of two non-random methods. No bonus XP is awarded for these options.\n> >     *   **Option A (Reroll):** Reroll the Characteristics using the method in step 2 until a satisfactory result is achieved.\n> >     *   **Option B (Point-Buy):** Allocate a total of **100 points** across the ten Characteristics. A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 18 points may be allocated to any single Characteristic *before* adding the species modifier.\n>\n> **C. Procedure - Derived Attributes & Initial Advances**\n> > **1. Calculate Wounds (W):** Determine the character's Strength Bonus (SB), Toughness Bonus (TB), and Willpower Bonus (WPB) by taking the tens digit of the corresponding Characteristic. Use the formula for the character's Species from the Attributes Table to calculate their starting Wounds.\n> > **2. Determine Fate & Resilience:** Consult the Attributes Table for the character's base Fate, Resilience, and number of \"Extra Points.\" The player may distribute these Extra Points between Fate and Resilience as they see fit.\n> > **3. Determine Fortune & Resolve:** The character's starting Fortune score is equal to their final Fate score. The character's starting Resolve score is equal to their final Resilience score.\n> > **4. Choose a Motivation:** The player must choose a one-word or short-phrase Motivation that drives their character (e.g., \"Thrillseeker,\" \"Protect the weak\").\n> > **5. Determine Movement (M):** Record the character's Movement value as listed on the Attributes Table.\n> > **6. Allocate Initial Career Advances:** The player must refer to their chosen Career's entry. They can allocate a total of **5 Advances** across the three Characteristics marked for initial advancement in the Career's Advance Scheme.\n>\n> **D. Master Attributes Table**\n> *Note: The 'Elf' column applies to both High Elves and Wood Elves.*\n>\n> | Attribute | Human | Dwarf | Halfling | Elf |\n> | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n> | **Weapon Skill** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+10 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Ballistic Skill** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Strength** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+10 | 2d10+20 |\n> | **Toughness** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 |\n> | **Initiative** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+40 |\n> | **Agility** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+10 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Dexterity** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Intelligence** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+20 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Willpower** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+40 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+30 |\n> | **Fellowship** | 2d10+20 | 2d10+10 | 2d10+30 | 2d10+20 |\n> | **Wounds** | SB+(2xTB)+WPB | SB+(2xTB)+WPB | (2xTB)+WPB | SB+(2xTB)+WPB |\n> | **Fate** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n> | **Resilience** | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n> | **Extra Points** | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 |\n> | **Movement** | 4 | 3 | 3 | 5 |\n\n---\n\n**VI. Step 4: Determine Skills and Talents**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> > **1. Select Species Skills & Talents:** The player must make selections from their character's Species list by consulting the `Reference: Skills and Talents (WFRP 4e)` document.\n> > *   Choose **3** Skills to receive **+5 Advances** each.\n> > *   Choose **3 different** Skills to receive **+3 Advances** each.\n> > *   Select all Talents, making choices where offered (e.g., 'Savvy or Suave') and rolling for any 'Random Talents'.\n> > **2. Select Career Skills & Talents:** The player now makes selections based on their starting Career level.\n> > *   Allocate a pool of **40 Advances** among the eight Skills listed for the starting Career level (max 10 per skill in this step).\n> > *   Choose **one** Talent from the four available at the starting Career level.\n>\n> **B. Reference**\n> *(For the lists of Species Skills/Talents and the Random Talent Table, refer to the `Reference: Skills and Talents (WFRP 4e)` document.)*\n\n---\n\n**VII. Step 5: Determine Trappings**\n> **A. Overview**\n> Trappings refer to all the equipment, clothing, weapons, and money a character begins the game with.\n>\n> **B. Procedure**\n> > **1. Record Class Trappings:** The character receives a set of general equipment based on their Class.\n> > **2. Record Career Trappings & Wealth:** The player must refer to their chosen Career's entry to get the list of specific trappings for their first career level. Their starting wealth is determined by their Career's Status.\n>\n> **C. Reference**\n> *(For the list of Class Trappings and the wealth calculation formula, refer to the `Reference: Trappings (WFRP 4e)` document.)*\n\n---\n\n**VIII. Step 6: Adding Detail**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> > **1. Determine Name and Appearance:** The player will be prompted to provide a name for their character. Afterwards, they may either specify the character's age, height, hair, and eye colour, or request that they be generated based on the norms for their species.\n> > **2. Define Personal Ambitions:** The player must define one Short-Term and one Long-Term Ambition for their character.\n> > *   **Reward (Short-Term):** Upon completion, the character receives **+50 XP**.\n> > *   **Reward (Long-Term):** Upon completion, the player chooses to either receive **+500 XP** or retire the character (granting half their total XP to the next character).\n\n---\n\n**IX. Step 7: Party & Companions**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> > **1. Determine Starting Group:** The player will be asked if their character is starting the adventure alone or with established companions.\n> > **2. Define Party Ambitions (If Applicable):** If starting with companions, the group must collectively decide on one Short-Term and one Long-Term Ambition for the party.\n> > *   **Reward (Short-Term):** Upon completion, each member receives **+50 XP**.\n> > *   **Reward (Long-Term):** Upon completion, each member may choose to either receive **+500 XP** or retire their character.\n\n---\n\n**X. Step 8: Bringing Your Character To Life**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> > **1. Answer the Ten Questions:** The player should consider and answer the following questions to build their character's backstory and personality.\n> > 1.  Where are you from?\n> > 2.  What is your family like?\n> > 3.  What was your childhood like?\n> > 4.  Why did you leave home?\n> > 5.  Who are your best friends?\n> > 6.  What is your greatest desire?\n> > 7.  What are your best and worst memories?\n> > 8.  What are your religious beliefs?\n> > 9.  To whom, or what, are you loyal?\n> > 10. Why are you adventuring?\n>\n> > **2. Dossier Generation:** The answers to the Ten Questions will be synthesized into a `Report: Character Dossier`. This report translates the narrative backstory into actionable hooks, relationships, and potential mechanical modifiers. It serves as a companion document to the `Report: Character Sheet`.\n> > **3. Optional - Psychology:** If the backstory reveals a powerful, defining emotional state, the player can discuss gaining a formal **Psychology** trait with the GM (e.g., Hatred, Animosity, Love).\n\n---\n\n**XI. Step 9: Initial Advancement**\n> **A. Procedure**\n> > **1. Tally Bonus XP:** Sum up all bonus XP awarded during the creation process.\n> > **2. Spend XP:** The player may spend this XP to purchase advances in the Skills, Talents, and Characteristics available to their starting Career.\n> > *   **Limitation:** XP can only be spent on the **8 Skills**, **4 Talents**, and **3 Characteristics** listed in the character's first Career level.\n> > *   **Reference:** Consult the `Reference: Advancement (WFRP 4e)` document for all XP costs.\n",

Core Philosophy: Creatures as Templates**\n> *   **Baseline Entries:** The creature entries we define will serve as generic, typical examples of their species.\n> *   **Encouraged Customization:** We are encouraged to customize these templates by adding or modifying **Skills**, **Talents**, and **Creature Traits**.\n> *   **Entry-Specific Optional Rules:** Certain creature entries may include unique optional rules (e.g., \"Dem Bones\" for Skeletons) noted on their entry.\n\n---\n\n**II. Bestiary Entry Structure**\n> *   **Name:** The creature’s common name.\n> *   **Description:** A brief overview of the creature.\n> *   **Profile:** The creature's core characteristics and derived stats.\n> *   **Traits:** A list of the Creature Traits the creature almost always possesses.\n> *   **Optional:** A list of common Creature Traits for creating variants.\n\n---\n\n**III. Applying Creature Traits for Customization**\n> *   **Generic Creature Traits:** The following traits can be appended to any creature: Afraid, Animosity, Armour, Big, Brute, Clever, Cunning, Elite, Fast, Hardy, Hatred, Leader, Prejudice, Tough, Weapon.\n> *   **Thematic Traits:** Note the use of traits like `Trained (Specialization)` for animals, which allows for significant customization by defining their role.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Hit Location Rules for Non-Humanoid Creatures**\n> *   **Standard Adaptations:** Arm hits become Foreleg hits for quadrupeds; Wing hits for birds.\n> *   **Large Creatures:** When attacking a creature 2+ Size categories larger, the attacker may choose a location to hit.\n> *   **Locations without Critical Tables:** Use the Arm Critical Wound Table for locations like tentacles, tails, or wings.\n> *   **Alternative Hit Location Tables:** Specific tables are used for creatures like Snakes and Spiders.\n\n---\n\n**V. The Size Subsystem (New Section)**\n> *   **Description:** This system defines the mechanical effects of a creature's size.\n>\n> **A. Size Categories**\n> | Category | Examples |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | Tiny | Butterfly, Mouse, Pigeon |\n> | Little | Cat, Hawk, Human Baby |\n> | Small | Giant Rat, Halfling, Human Child |\n> | Average | Dwarf, Elf, Human |\n> | Large | Horse, Ogre, Troll |\n> | Enormous | Griffon, Wyvern, Manticore |\n> | Monstrous | Dragon, Giant, Greater Daemon |\n>\n> **B. Modifying Characteristics by Size**\n> *   For each step a creature increases in size, it gains **+10 Strength** and **+10 Toughness**, and suffers **–5 Agility**.\n> *   This process is reversed for each step a creature decreases in size.\n>\n> **C. Calculating Wounds by Size**\n> | Size | Wounds Formula |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | Tiny | 1 |\n> | Little | TB |\n> | Small | (2 × TB) + WPB |\n> | Average | SB + (2 × TB) + WPB |\n> | Large | (SB + (2 × TB) + WPB) × 2 |\n> | Enormous | (SB + (2 × TB) + WPB) × 4 |\n> | Monstrous | (SB + (2 × TB) + WPB) × 8 |\n>\n> **D. Combat Rules by Size**\n> *   **Damage & Qualities:** If a creature is 1 step larger than its target, its weapons gain the **Damaging** quality. If 2+ steps larger, they gain the **Impact** quality.\n> *   **Damage Multiplier:** Damage caused is multiplied by the number of size steps the creature is larger than its target (e.g., a Large creature attacking a Small creature multiplies final damage by x2).\n> *   **Deathblow:** All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule.\n> *   **Hitting Smaller Targets:** A creature gains a **+10 bonus** to hit targets smaller than itself.\n> *   **Defending vs. Larger Targets:** A creature suffers a **–2 SL penalty** for each step larger its opponent is when using Melee to defend.\n> *   **Fear & Terror:** An aggressive creature causes **Fear** in smaller creatures, and **Terror** in creatures 2+ steps smaller. The rating equals the size step difference.\n> *   **Movement:** A larger creature ignores the need to Disengage from smaller combatants.\n> *   **Opposed Strength:** A creature 2+ steps larger automatically wins. If 1 step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest.\n> *   **Stomp Attack:** A larger creature can spend 1 Advantage to make a Free Attack (Stomp) against a smaller opponent. Damage = SB+0.\n\n---",

            "comment": "Guideline: Running the Game",
            "content": "### **`Guideline: Running the Game`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To provide a practical checklist of best practices and mechanical reminders for preparing and executing a game session, from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n**I. General Advice & Best Practices**\n> *   **System Mastery:** Know the rulebook well. Bookmark or reference frequently used sections (e.g., `Chapter 8: Magic` for a Wizard player).\n> *   **Player-Centric Planning:** Give players what they want from the game while advancing the plot. Ensure new characters have a reason to adventure together.\n> *   **Content Awareness:** Be prepared to handle or bypass content that a player may find uncomfortable.\n> *   **Challenge Design:** Set achievable challenges. Ensure that critical enemies are defeatable. Balance difficult or horrific scenes with moments of light relief.\n> *   **Pacing & Emphasis:** Intentionally decide which parts of an adventure should be resolved quickly and which should be dramatic and challenging.\n> *   **Narrative Flow:** Identify which story beats are critical for a satisfying conclusion and have plans to guide the players toward them without railroading.\n> *   **Improvisation Aids:** Prepare lists of descriptive phrases appropriate for the adventure's locations. Give minor NPCs a single memorable feature (accent, tic, catchphrase) to make them distinct.\n> *   **Creative Challenges:** Present problems that require improvisation or creative thinking from the players.\n> *   **Fairness & Fun:** When in doubt, err on the side of having fun. Be firm but fair when interpreting Test results. Make a significant narrative moment out of the use or gain of Fate and Resilience points.\n\n---\n\n**II. Rules Notes & Mechanical Focus**\n> *   **Tests:** The choice of Test type (Simple, Dramatic, Opposed) is a key tool for controlling the game's pace. (Reference: `Cheat Sheet: Core Tests`)\n> *   **Fortune Points:** Actively encourage players to spend Fortune points. Remind them of this resource if they are hoarding them, as it can turn a failure into a success. (Reference: `Cheat Sheet: Meta-Currencies`)\n> *   **Advantage:** Advantage creates momentum but is fragile. It is lost upon losing an Opposed Test, taking damage, or gaining a Condition. Remind players that they can Disengage, flee, or use ranged attacks to break an enemy's Advantage. A character can also spend a Resilience point to automatically win an Opposed Test, clearing all enemy Advantage. (Reference: `Cheat Sheet: Advantage`)\n> *   **Opposed Tests:** Combat is primarily resolved through Opposed Tests. A winner is always determined by the difference in SL, meaning even unskilled combatants can land blows. (Reference: `Cheat Sheet: Core Tests`)\n> *   **No Opposition:** An opponent who refuses to defend themselves is considered Helpless and can be attacked without an Opposed Test.\n\n---\n\n**III. Session Zero: Character Creation**\n> **A. Session Management**\n> *   Character creation can be time-consuming. It is often best to dedicate the first full session to this process. Inform the players of this plan to manage their expectations.\n> *   Guide new players through the process, explaining how the different parts of their character sheet will be used in the game.\n>\n> **B. Group Cohesion & Motivation**\n> *   **Encourage Coordination:** Guide players to coordinate their choices to build a broadly capable group. A good spread of Classes provides more options for both the players and the GM.\n> *   **Shared Backstories:** Encourage players to involve other characters in their backgrounds. Provide suggestions to help forge these connections, which will bind the group together and simplify the creation of a Group Ambition.\n> *   **Establish the 'Why':** The group must have a reason to stick together and engage with adventures. Directly ask the players to explain why their characters work together and will continue to do so. Avoid creating a group of disparate individuals who refuse to cooperate.\n> *   **External Motivations:** If internal cohesion is weak, introduce external motivators: the promise of an irresistible reward, or a \"request\" from a powerful patron who cannot be refused.\n>\n> **C. Adventure Integration**\n> *   Having a clear idea of the upcoming adventure allows you to weave connections directly into character backgrounds.\n> *   **Example:** If the adventure involves a smuggling ring, work with the Smuggler character to integrate that ring into their personal history.\n> *   **Example:** If a Chaos Cult is central to the plot, perhaps a key member of a character's family is secretly a member. These personal stakes create a more immersive and engaging game.\n>\n> **D. Player Comfort & Expectations**\n> *   The character creation session is the ideal time to discuss the desired tone of the game.\n> *   **Identify Content to Avoid:** It is crucial to identify sensitive topics (e.g., graphic violence, specific phobias, etc.) that players may wish to avoid.\n> *   **Provide Private Channels:** Some players may not be comfortable discussing these topics openly. Ensure everyone has a way to communicate their preferences to you privately. You do not need to ask for reasons; the preference is enough.\n> *   **Prioritize Fun:** When in doubt, err on the side of caution. The goal is for everyone to have fun in a comfortable environment.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Post-Session Procedures**\n> **A. Ending the Session**\n> *   Conclude each session in a narratively satisfying way. Aim for a moment of resolution, a significant revelation, a deepening mystery, or a cliffhanger to build anticipation for the next session.\n>\n> **B. Awarding Experience Points (XP)**\n> *   **Philosophy:** At the end of every session, award XP to the players. Use this as an opportunity to reward positive engagement. It is better to use the carrot than the stick; reward players who demonstrated good cooperation and roleplaying rather than punishing those who did not.\n> *   **Bonuses:** Award additional bonuses of **25-50 XP** for excellent roleplaying, strong teamwork, or other contributions that made the game more fun for everyone.\n> *   **Published Adventures:** If running a pre-written adventure, it will provide its own suggested XP awards for each session.\n>\n> *   **Experience Point Awards Table**\n>\n> | Session Type | Performance | XP Award |\n> | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n> | **Normal Session** | Poor | 75 XP |\n> | | Good | 100 XP |\n> | | Exceptional | 125 XP |\n> | **End of Adventure** | Poor | 100 XP |\n> | | Good | 150 XP |\n> | | Exceptional | 200 XP |\n> | **End of Campaign** | Poor | 150 XP |\n> | | Good | 200 XP |\n> | | Exceptional | 250 XP |\n>\n> **C. Awarding Fate & Resilience Points**\n> *   **Significance:** Spending a permanent point of Fate or Resilience is a major event for a character, as it also reduces their corresponding pool of Fortune or Resolve. Awarding these points back is an equally rare and special occurrence.\n> *   **Awarding Fate:** A permanent Fate point should be awarded at the conclusion of a long and significant adventure or campaign.\n> *   **Awarding Resilience:** A permanent Resilience point should be awarded when a character achieves something of extraordinary personal significance, directly in line with their core Motivations.\n",

Pacing Travel**\n> The GM can choose how to represent travel. For short or narratively unimportant journeys, it can be resolved with a simple description of the time passed and key sights. For more significant journeys, the following rules should be used to detail the experience.\n\n**II. Calculating Travel Time**\n> *   **Travel Speed:** A party's travel speed in miles per hour is determined by its slowest member's **Movement** characteristic. A character with Movement 3 travels at 3 mph.\n> *   **Daily Travel:** A party can travel for a total of **6 hours** per day without penalty.\n> *   **Forced March:** If the party wishes to travel faster or for longer than 6 hours, each character involved must make an **Endurance Test**. Those who fail gain one **Fatigued** Condition. This test is made with a penalty if the character is Encumbered.\n> *   **River Speed:** A barge's speed can be increased or decreased by up to 30% if it is travelling downstream or upstream, respectively, at the GM's discretion.\n\n**III. Travel Costs**\n> The costs below are per mile and serve as a general guide. Faster transport typically costs double, while slower options may cost half. These prices do not include meals, lodging, or fodder unless purchased as a package.\n>\n> | Transport | Movement | Cost |\n> | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n> | **Coach (Inside)** | 6 | 2d per mile |\n> | **Coach (Outside)** | 6 | 1d per mile |\n> | **Barge (Cabin)** | 8 | 5d per mile |\n> | **Barge (Deck)** | 8 | 2d per mile |\n> | **Cab (Urban)** | 6 | 3d per district |\n> | **Ferry (Crossing)** | 4 | 1d per 20 yards |\n\n**IV. Using Travel Events**\n> **A. Purpose**\n> Travel events are used to break up long journeys, introduce new challenges, and reinforce the themes of the adventure. They can provide a change of pace (a simple combat in an intrigue-heavy game), foreshadow future threats, or make the antagonists' actions feel more personal.\n>\n> **B. Triggering Events**\n> The GM decides when an event occurs. Common methods include:\n> *   **Once per journey** of a day or more.\n> *   Rolling **1d10 per day** of travel; an event occurs on a roll of **8**.\n> *   At the GM's discretion to advance the narrative.\n>\n> **C. Resolving Events**\n> Events can range from a brief narrative description to a full encounter forming the basis of a session. The GM should use the **`Reference: Travel Events Table`** for inspiration. Players may be given an opportunity to avoid negative events with a successful **Perception**, **Outdoor Survival**, or other relevant Test. If travelling on paid transport, they may receive assistance in overcoming adversities.\n",

            "content": "### **`Guideline: Character Progression (Classes & Careers)`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To explain the core mechanics of Classes, Careers, and the process of character advancement through Experience Points (XP).\n\n---\n\n**I. Core Concepts: Classes & Careers**\n\n> *‘Well, I play a character with no class at all who would sell his grandmother for career advancement; you know, exactly the type of fellow frequently encountered in my line of work.’*\n> — Detlef Sierck, Playwright and Actor\n\nYour **Career** is your character's profession and social standing, while your **Class** is a broader grouping of similar Careers. These elements are fundamental to your character's identity and how they develop over time.\n\n**A. Classes**\n> A Class is a high-level category that organizes Careers into eight distinct groups: Academics, Burghers, Courtiers, Peasants, Rangers, Riverfolk, Rogues, and Warriors. A character's Class has several mechanical effects:\n> *   It determines the pool of available Careers during character creation.\n> *   It provides a specific set of starting equipment (**Trappings**).\n> *   It influences the options for changing Careers later in the game.\n> *   It can grant access to unique **Endeavours** during downtime between adventures.\n\n**B. Careers**\n> A Career represents a specific job or role within the Empire. Each Career is designed to be a broad concept, and you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively.\n>\n> *   **Career Levels:** Every Career consists of four distinct levels of seniority and skill. For example, the Apothecary career path progresses from Apprentice Apothecary (Level 1) to Apothecary-General (Level 4). All new characters begin at the first level of their chosen Career.\n\n**C. Gender and Careers**\n> Although some Career names may be gendered due to the limitations of language, all careers are intended for characters of any gender. No matter how your character identifies, all career paths are available to them. While some cults may be more commonly associated with one gender (e.g., the cults of Taal and Ulric with men, Rhya and Shallya with women), deities like Sigmar and Verena have an equal appeal to all, and anyone may serve any god.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Advancement Process**\n\nCharacters improve by spending Experience Points (XP) to purchase **Advances**. Your current Career Level dictates which Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available for you to advance.\n\n**A. Characteristic Advances**\n> Each Career has an **Advance Scheme** that shows which of the 10 Characteristics can be improved at each Career Level.\n> *   **Level 1 (Initial):** You can advance the three Characteristics marked with a **h** symbol.\n> *   **Level 2 (Brass 🛡️):** You gain access to one additional Characteristic.\n> *   **Level 3 (Silver ⚔️):** You gain access to one additional Characteristic.\n> *   **Level 4 (Gold 💀):** You gain access to the final Characteristic.\n>\n> Each purchase of a Characteristic Advance adds **+1** to that Characteristic's value. The XP cost for each advance increases based on how many advances you have already purchased for that specific Characteristic, as detailed in the `Reference: Advancement (WFRP 4e)` document.\n>\n> *Note: Weapon Skill (WS) and Ballistic Skill (BS) are considered Characteristics for the purposes of advancement.*\n\n**B. Skill Advances**\n> You can purchase advances in any Skill listed for your **current Career Level and all lower levels**.\n> *   **Example:** A Master Apothecary (Level 3) can purchase advances in Skills from the Master Apothecary, Apothecary (Level 2), and Apothecary's Apprentice (Level 1) lists.\n>\n> Each purchase of a Skill Advance adds **+1** to that Skill's value. The XP cost is determined by the number of advances already purchased for that specific Skill, as detailed in the `Reference: Advancement (WFRP 4e)` document.\n>\n> *Note: The Skill marked in italics on your first Career Level is the one used for making **Income Endeavour** tests during downtime.*\n\n**C. Talent Advances**\n> You can only purchase Talents listed for the specific Career Level you are currently in. Talents from higher or lower levels of your career path are not available.\n>\n> *   **Cost:** The first time you purchase a Talent, it costs **100 XP**. Each subsequent time you purchase the *same* Talent, the cost increases by 100 XP (e.g., 200 XP for the second time, 300 XP for the third, and so on).\n> *   **Multiple Purchases:** Not all Talents can be taken more than once. You must consult the Talent's description to see if it offers additional benefits for multiple purchases.\n\n**D. Non-Career Advances (The 'Double Cost' Rule)**\n> You may wish to improve abilities outside of your current Career's scope.\n> *   **Characteristics & Skills:** With GM approval, you may purchase advances in Characteristics and Skills not listed in your Career. This costs **double** the normal XP amount. The GM may require an in-game justification, such as finding a tutor or undergoing special training.\n> *   **Talents:** Normally, you **cannot** purchase Talents from outside your Career path with XP. However, the **Training** and **Unusual Learning** Endeavours (see `Guideline: Between Adventures (Downtime)`) provide specific opportunities to do so.\n\n---\n\n**III. Changing Careers**\n\nWhen you have taken all the advances you want from your current Career Level, you may spend XP to change Careers. This can mean moving to a different level within your current career path or moving to an entirely new career.\n\n**A. Completing a Career Level**\n> To be considered \"complete\" in your current Career Level (which makes changing careers cheaper), you must meet all of the following criteria:\n> *   You have purchased the required number of advances in **all** Characteristics available at your Career Level.\n> *   You have purchased the required number of advances in at least **eight** of the Skills available at your Career Level.\n> *   You have purchased at least **one** Talent from your Career Level.\n>\n> | Career Level | Required Advances |\n> | :--- | :--- |\n> | Level 1 | 5 |\n> | Level 2 | 10 |\n> | Level 3 | 15 |\n> | Level 4 | 20 |\n>\n> *Note: You are never forced to leave a Career Level, even after completing it.*\n\n**B. The Cost of Changing Careers**\n> *   **From a Completed Level:** 100 XP\n> *   **From an Incomplete Level:** 200 XP\n> *   **Moving to a Different Class:** An additional +100 XP\n\n**C. Types of Career Changes**\n> *   **Changing Level:** You can move to the next sequential level in your career path (e.g., Level 2 to 3). With GM permission, you can also move to a lower level or even skip levels if a significant in-game event justifies it.\n> *   **Changing Career:** You can move to the first level of any other Career. This is cheapest if the new Career is within your current Class. With GM permission and strong narrative justification, you may even be able to enter a new Career at a higher level (e.g., moving from a Level 3 Academic to a Level 3 Courtier).\n> *   **In-Game Offers:** The GM may offer you a direct entry into a new Career as a result of story events (e.g., being conscripted into the army makes you a Soldier). These story-driven changes are encouraged.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Interpreting Your Career**\n\n**A. Customising Trappings**\n> The Trappings listed for each Career are guidelines. You should feel free to customize them to fit your specific character concept. For example, a Soldier representing a Handgunner should have different trappings than one representing a Halberdier.\n>\n> Your Trappings are also how you are recognized. Lacking the proper attire and tools may cause others to doubt your status or profession, while displaying them prominently can grant you authority.\n",

General Weapon Rules**\n\n*   **The \"Hand Weapon\" Category:** This is a generic classification for common, one-handed melee weapons. It includes standard swords, axes, maces, and short spears. For game purposes, they share the same core statistics unless otherwise noted.\n*   **Weapon Damage & Repair:**\n    *   When a weapon sustains damage (from a Fumble, spell, or other effect), its Damage value is reduced by 1 for each point of damage taken.\n    *   If a weapon's Damage is reduced to +0 (or +SB+0), it is ruined and now functions only as an Improvised Weapon.\n    *   An Improvised Weapon that takes damage is rendered useless for combat.\n    *   Weapons can be repaired by a skilled artisan for 10% of the weapon's base cost per point of damage repaired. Ruined weapons cannot be fixed.\n\n---\n\n**II. Melee Combat Rules**\n\n**A. Melee Weapon Groups**\n> Each melee weapon group corresponds to a specific Melee Skill (e.g., Melee (Flail), Melee (Polearm)).\n> *   **Untrained Use:** If you use a weapon from a group in which you have no advances, you test against your base Weapon Skill characteristic. You suffer all of the weapon's Flaws but gain none of the benefits of its Qualities.\n> *   **Cavalry Group:** These weapons are designed for mounted combat. When used on foot, two-handed cavalry weapons follow the rules for the Two-Handed group.\n> *   **Flail Group:** An unskilled user (no advances in Melee (Flail)) treats the weapon as having the **Dangerous** Flaw and cannot use any of its other Qualities.\n> *   **Parry Group:** Any one-handed weapon with the **Defensive** Quality can be used with the Melee (Parry) skill, allowing you to oppose incoming attacks without suffering the standard -20 penalty for using an off-hand.\n\n**B. Weapon Reach**\n> A weapon's reach determines its effective length in a confrontation. The specific engagement distances for each Reach category are defined in the **`reach_data.json`** file.\n\n**C. Optional Rule: Weapon Length & In-Fighting**\n> *   **Weapon Length Advantage:** If your weapon's Reach is longer than your opponent's, they suffer a **–10 penalty** on their Melee Tests to hit you.\n> *   **In-Fighting:** As your Action, you can initiate an **Opposed Melee Test** to close the distance. The winner decides if the fight continues normally or becomes \"in-fighting.\" During in-fighting, any weapon with a Reach longer than **Short** is treated as an Improvised Weapon.\n\n---\n\n**III. Ranged Combat Rules**\n\n**A. Ranged Weapon Groups**\n> Ranged weapons require specialized training. You cannot attempt a Ranged Test with a weapon if you do not have the correct Ranged Skill specialization.\n> *   **Exceptions for Untrained/Cross-Trained Use:**\n>     *   **Blackpowder/Explosives:** Characters with Ranged (Engineering) can use these weapons without penalty.\n>     *   **Crossbow/Throwing:** You may attempt to use these weapons by testing your base Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all its Qualities while retaining all its Flaws.\n>     *   **Engineering:** Characters with Ranged (Blackpowder) may use Engineering weapons, but they lose all Qualities while retaining all Flaws.\n> *   **Ammunition:** Blunderbusses are the only listed weapons that use Small Shot or Improvised Shot. All other Blackpowder and Engineering weapons use standard bullets.\n\n**B. Calculating Range Bands**\n> A weapon's listed Range is its \"Medium\" band. Other bands are calculated by multiplying this value. The specific multipliers for each range band are defined in the **`range_bands.json`** file.\n",

One: friendship means nothing. Two: without ambition you’re nothing. Three: no matter how fruitless the prospect, you can always squeeze more blood from a stone.’*\n> — Ubel Rikard-Goellner, Merchant Prince\n\n---\n\n**I. The Imperial Currency System**\n\n**A. Denominations & Conversion**\n> The economy of the Empire primarily operates on a system of three coin denominations: Gold Crowns (GC), Silver Shillings (/), and Brass Pennies (d).\n> *   1 Gold Crown = 20 Silver Shillings\n> *   1 Silver Shilling = 12 Brass Pennies\n> *   1 Gold Crown = 240 Brass Pennies\n>\n> *   **The Noble:** A less common but accepted coin is the *noble*, worth 80 Brass Pennies (or one-third of a Gold Crown).\n> *   **Foreign Currency:** Coins from other nations are often accepted, but their value is determined by weighing them on a set of scales. Using foreign currency may attract suspicion from merchants and officials.\n\n**B. Encumbrance of Coinage**\n> Coins have weight and contribute to a character's total Encumbrance.\n> *   **100 coins** (of any denomination) are equal to **1 point of Encumbrance**.\n\n---\n\n**II. The Marketplace: Buying, Selling, & Trading**\n\nThe GM can choose to handle shopping trips in several ways, from detailed roleplaying encounters to simple dice rolls. The following rules provide the framework for these interactions.\n\n**A. Finding an Item (Availability)**\n> All trappings have an Availability rating: **Common, Scarce, Rare,** or **Exotic**.\n>\n> *   **Common:** These items are found in nearly every settlement and are always considered to be in stock.\n> *   **Scarce & Rare:** To find these items, you must succeed on an Availability Test. The percentage chance for this test, based on settlement size, is defined in the **`market_data.json`** file.\n> *   **Exotic:** These items cannot be found with a simple test and are only available at the GM's discretion or through specific Endeavours.\n>\n> *   **Improving Your Chances:** The GM may grant a **+10% to +20% bonus** to the Availability Test if a character is particularly diligent, makes successful **Gossip Tests**, or belongs to a relevant career.\n\n**B. Negotiating the Price (Haggling & Evaluation)**\n> Bargaining is an expected part of commerce in the Empire.\n>\n> *   **Evaluate:** This skill is used to assess an item's quality, spot counterfeit coins, or estimate the value of Rare or Exotic items.\n> *   **Haggle:** This skill is used to negotiate prices via an **Opposed Haggle Test**. A success typically reduces the price by 10-20%.\n\n**C. Using Guild Contacts (Optional Rule)**\n> If you fail an Availability Test for an item relevant to your guild, you may make a **Gossip Test** to consult with your fellow Guilders. On a success, you may **reroll the failed Availability Test**.\n\n**D. Selling Your Wares**\n> Selling items follows the same process as buying. The starting value for a second-hand item is typically **half its listed price**. For each time you **halve the asking price**, the Availability of a buyer **increases by one step** (e.g., from Exotic to Rare).\n\n**E. Bartering**\n> In many parts of the Empire, goods are traded for other goods. The exchange rates for items of different Availability ratings are defined in the **`market_data.json`** file.\n\n---\n\n**III. Craftsmanship & Item Quality**\n\n*   **Item Quality:** For each net Quality, an item's price is **doubled** and its Availability becomes **one step more difficult**.\n*   **Item Flaw:** For each net Flaw, an item's price is **halved** and its Availability becomes **one step easier**.\n*   A successful **Evaluate Test** is required to identify an item's Flaws before purchase.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Cost of Living & Status**\n\n> To maintain your station, you should spend approximately half of your Status value in shillings each day.\n\n---\n\n**V. Criminal Coinage**\n\n*   **Counterfeiting & Clipping:** Creating or shaving coins requires **Art (Engraving)** and **Trade (Smithing)** Tests. Detecting them requires an **Evaluate Test**.\n\n---\n\n**VI. Optional Rule: Abstracted Wealth**\n\n> You can freely acquire items costing less than your Status level in its primary currency.

Core Concept**\n> While direct answers to prayer are typically reserved for the Blessed, the gods of the Old World do occasionally listen to the pleas of the common faithful. This optional rule provides a mechanic for resolving such moments of potential divine intervention.\n\n**II. Trigger Conditions**\n> A \"Little Prayer\" can only be attempted when all of the following conditions are met:\n> 1.  The character is **not** a Blessed of any god (i.e., does not have the *Bless* or *Invoke* Talents).\n> 2.  The prayer is offered at a designated **Holy Site** (temple, shrine, chapel, etc.).\n> 3.  The character makes an appropriate **offering**.\n> 4.  The character's motivation and the goal of their prayer align with the sphere of influence of the deity being petitioned.\n\n**III. Resolution Process**\n> 1.  **GM Discretion:** The GM determines if the trigger conditions are appropriately met.\n> 2.  **The Roll:** The GM secretly rolls **1d100**.\n> 3.  **Base Chance:** The prayer is answered on a roll of **01**.\n> 4.  **Modifiers:**\n>     *   If the character possesses the **Pray Skill**, the chance of success may be increased at the GM's discretion (e.g., success on a roll of 01-05).\n\n**IV. Outcome & Effects**\n> If the prayer is answered, the divine intervention should be subtle and not a direct granting of wishes. The effect should help the character achieve a goal that is important to the deity. Examples include:\n> *   A temporary, one-time bonus to a relevant dice roll (e.g., +1 SL or +10).\n> *   A one-shot use of a Skill the character does not possess.\n> *   A brief, context-appropriate advantage (e.g., an enemy momentarily stumbles, a locked door is found to be unsecured).\n> *   A moment of insight or a cryptic but helpful omen.\n\n---\n",

            "content": "### **`Guideline: Armour Mechanics`**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To define the core rules for wearing, using, damaging, and repairing armour, as well as the tactical options and special properties it provides.\n\n---\n\n**I. Wearing Armour**\n\nThe protection offered by armour often comes at the cost of mobility, stealth, or perception.\n\n*   **Penalties:** Specific penalties associated with wearing a piece of armour are listed in its stat block. These are applied in addition to any penalties from Encumbrance.\n*   **Stacking Armour Types:**\n    *   **Soft Leather:** Can be worn underneath any other type of armour without incurring additional penalties.\n    *   **Mail & Plate:** Wearing any piece of Mail armour confers a –10 penalty to Stealth Tests. Wearing any piece of Plate armour confers an additional, separate –10 penalty to Stealth Tests. These effects are cumulative.\n\n---\n\n**II. Armour Damage & Repair**\n\nArmour degrades as it absorbs the punishment of combat.\n\n**A. Sustaining Damage**\n> An armour piece's protective value is measured in Armour Points (APs). When an effect instructs you to damage armour, the APs of the specific hit location are reduced by 1. If a location's APs are reduced to 0, the armour in that spot is rendered useless. Armour is typically damaged in one of two ways:\n> 1.  A specific talent, spell, or weapon quality (like **Hack**) damages it.\n> 2.  The wearer chooses to use Critical Deflection (see below).\n\n**B. Repairing Armour**\n> Damaged armour can be restored by a skilled artisan.\n> *   **Cost:** The cost to repair is **10% of the armour's base price per AP lost**.\n> *   **Broken Sections:** If a section of armour has been reduced to 0 AP, the cost to fix that section increases to **30% of the armour's base price**.\n> *   **Requirements:** You can repair your own armour if you possess the appropriate Trade Skill and Trade Tools. Repairing Plate armour additionally requires a dedicated Workshop.\n\n---\n\n**III. Critical Deflection**\n\nA character can choose to sacrifice their armour to avoid a debilitating blow.\n\n*   **Mechanic:** When you suffer a Critical Wound on a location protected by armour, you may choose to let the armour absorb the impact. If you do so, you **ignore all effects of the Critical Wound**.\n*   **The Cost:** The armour on that location is damaged, permanently losing **1 AP**. You still suffer all normal Wounds from the attack, and may even take more due to the newly reduced AP value.\n\n---\n\n**IV. Armour Qualities & Flaws**\n\nArmour can possess special properties that alter its performance. The specific effects of each Quality and Flaw are detailed in the `qualities_and_flaws` section of the **`armour_properties.json`** data file.\n\n---\n\n**V. Optional Rule: Quick Armour**\n\nFor a more streamlined experience, a simplified system can be used in place of tracking individual armour pieces. This system categorizes armour into three general tiers. The stats for each tier are detailed in the `quick_armour_table` section of the **`armour_properties.json`** data file.\n",
